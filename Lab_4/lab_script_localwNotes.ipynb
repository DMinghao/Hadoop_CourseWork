    "\n",
    "The first reason is because it is the easiest one example to understand the logic behind hadoop for rookies in this area lol. \n",
    "The second reason is that this example has huge amount of applications.\n",
    "The most straightforward example is that it helps companies like Amazon to calculate which items are the most frequently bought ones by customers. \n",
    "We can also figure out the most frequent doubleton or tripleton items. I believe everyone heard of the beer and diaper case, right? That is an easy task for Hadoop system.\n",
