479,Virgin America,@VirginAmerica how come ABC is the only one of the network channels you don't have?
480,Virgin America,@VirginAmerica started my flight with a scolding for using an overhead bin that was then offered to the person seated next to me.
481,Virgin America,".@VirginAmerica not only was it great, but you return my calls the day after. Couldn't ask for more. #myVXexperience"
482,Virgin America,"@VirginAmerica While other airlines weren't Cancelled Flighting flights into BOS, and helping their customers get home, Virgin was saying Good luck!"
483,Virgin America,"@VirginAmerica Dear Virgin customer, while you're stranded in SF for 3 days &amp; $1000cost- we'll do the very least we can to accommodate you!"
484,Virgin America,@VirginAmerica should use this in their next airline commercial lol :: http://t.co/pXEXIlSjBs
485,Virgin America,@VirginAmerica Grouping Virgin in with the others now. BOS weather has exposed their actual Cus Serv model. Never Flight Booking Problems with Virgin again!
486,Virgin America,"@VirginAmerica As one of the travelers affected by the Boston storm, I'm shocked at Virgin's complete apathy toward their customers."
487,Virgin America,@VirginAmerica Umm so no reason as to why this is? Is there someone different I should contact (or contact me) to get a definitive answer?
488,Virgin America,@virginamerica Trying to make the change in advance (not just 24 hours prior)‚Ä¶tried it online earlier and it wanted $300 in change fees.
489,Virgin America,"@VirginAmerica so loyal that I'm driving to #NYC from #PA, to fly Virgin,  since you cut #Philly flights ;)"

497,Virgin America,@VirginAmerica my group got their Cancelled Flightlation fees waived but I can't because my ticket is booked for 2/18? Your reps were no help either üò°

505,United,@united thanks
506,United,@united Thanks for taking care of that MR!! Happy customer.
507,United,@united still no refund or word via DM. Please resolve this issue as your Cancelled Flightled flight was useless to my assistant's trip.
508,United,@united Delayed due to lack of crew and now delayed again because there's a long line for deicing... Still need to improve service #united
509,United,@united thanks -- we filled it out. How's our luck with this? Is it common?
510,United,@united Your ERI-ORD express connections are hugely popular .. now if only we could have an ERI-EWR hop! :)
511,United,@united even on international flight Glasgow to the U.S.? Then what about orlando to Newark? All 90 mins?
512,United,@united you think you boarded flight AU1066 too early? I think so.
513,United,"@united I understand, but it's tough when there is no way to get to the airport w/o serious risk of an accident. It's a steep price."
514,United,"@united Gate agent hooked me up with alternate flights. If you have a way to PREVENT the constant issues, that would rock."
515,United,@united flying gla-mco in a few weeks. How long do we have to be at airport for before departure for both international and domestic? Ta
516,United,@united thanks
517,United,@united Thanks. It is on the same ticket.
518,United,@united why not? Is it a law or a policy?
519,United,@united is the worst. Nonrefundable First class tickets? Oh because when you select Global/FC their system auto selects economy w/upgrade.
520,United,@united @CheerTymeDad So I can buy tix 3 days before flight but can't transfer the tix.  Flawed security logic. Flawed customer service
521,United,"@united I did start a claim but 8-10 weeks is unrealistic, am I really supposed to go that long with out a car seat for my child.Ridiculous!"
522,United,@united follow me please this airline is beautifull ‚ô•
523,United,"@united no I don't, but I'm sure United have my info on its system."
524,United,"@united if the car seat is lost @united should just reimburse me for a new one, this is not a pair of shoes, it's a necessity for my child"
525,United,@united Just submitted my response on the link you sent.
526,United,"@united yes, David Allan send an email with this number (KMM24999563V99860L0KM) and case#8719519"
527,United,@united @highbuddyyy that totally sucks my cousin worked at PHL said @united
528,United,@united just wanted to let you know how wonderful Rosetta the gate agent was working flight 6457 Dan to Ase. Let her know she wasappreciated
529,United,"@united yes, a paper voucher that I got on January 26th 2015"
530,United,@united beginning of Feb I called United they said they would send another voucher by mail. Never got anything. #tiredofwaiting
531,United,"@United the internet is a great thing.  I am emailing executives in your company, maybe they will respond to me in a timely manner."
532,United,"@united Do I need to use a Chase United Club pass for my 8yr old son, or can he come in with me on my pass?"
533,United,@united and what am I suppose to do with that number?
534,United,"@united thats weak. See ya üëã
Hey @VirginAmerica !!"
535,United,@united I flew back w other company since United didnt have an earlier flight
536,United,@united I lost a voucher that I was given in Miami aeroport on jan 26. I did not use it.
537,United,@united I am trying to book awards for September and need flights on @aegeanairlines but they will not show even w/ many award seats availab
538,United,@united I sure did.   I had to drive a total of 3 hours to get my own bag.  I'd like to explain that debacle but no one wants to talk to me.
539,United,@united @CheerTymeDad Gee that's like almost caring about ppl more than $$.  Think I'm more int in having a trusted adult w/ daughter .
540,United,"@united See? We were told repeatedly that the pilot was Late Flight and kept getting Late Flightr.  After we boarded, there was a defibrillator issue."
541,United,@united why no preferred security line anymore. My TSA pre-check didn't pull on my @SilverAirways partner flight! #Platinum #spoiled
542,United,@united #Newarkliberty Airport need to indicate different gate#'s for terminals A&amp;C. #Flyingainteasy
543,United,"@united yes please! I am newly married and trying to update my last name on a preexisting international flight! It seems so easy, but..."
544,United,@united How does United refuse to reissue a $400 lost voucher when their plane didn't take off due to mechanics? #badcustomerservice
545,United,"@united also during the run I was instructed to do, I shattered my computer. http://t.co/oAflfr7WXB"
546,United,"@united yes, we've been with the agents for the last 50 minutes. One of the agents have been very rude, but thankfully Ladan has been nice."
547,United,@united that's right- with an overnight Miami.
548,United,@united Have clients with an 11 hr layover at IAH (during the day). Will they have to claim &amp; recheck luggage. Or will it be taken care of?
549,United,"@united I am trying to find out if the loaner seat is new or used, a used car seat is illegal according to safety regulations"
550,United,@united i DMed you the details
551,United,"@united iah to charlotte. Baggage claim rep latrice h. #customerservice non existent, Ignored customer then inappropriately touched customer"
552,United,"@united Kewl. Will also let them know the overhead bin over my row was ""Inop"". I love a good abbreve."
553,United,"@united - thanks for your help...got me what I need, but its an issue with @_austrian . I guess I sit awhile longer."
554,United,@united @UCtraveladvisor - I would have loved to respond to your website until I saw the really long form. In business the new seats are bad
555,United,@united A refund and flight vouchers or another flight on a different airline at your expense for today. 8 hour drive is very inconvenient
556,United,@united then why have I not received my call back its been 3 days...it's an infant car seat how am I supposed to go anywhere with my child
557,United,@united thanks again for your concern. I will contact customer care upon our return from Australia.
558,United,@United well sitting on the ground 'on time' but waiting for a gate....again #tiredofthis
559,United,"@united ""Airport snow removal method #22...""
Keep up the good work folks, this is where Cessna's become 747's! http://t.co/9v8tMUsJvU"
560,United,"@united No, I need you guys to not over book planes. It's not a concern, I'll just travel with someone else moving forward."
561,United,@united A measly $50 e-certificate is not how you appreciate loyal customers after they wait 3hrs on the tarmac during UA1116. #unacceptable
562,United,@united When will email address/username sign-on be available? It's been a while.
563,United,@united Thank you for that. Am I able to claim any interim expenses or is the cost of the stuff up on me?
564,United,@united rude rude
565,United,@united - Why can't I get a boarding pass for my Austrian Airlines codeshare flight. Rebook incls a 6 hour layover &amp; I am stuck outside sec
566,United,@united. ..I received on other flights. #united  truly breaks guitars. #unitedbreaksguitars #wantmymoneyback
567,United,@united just flew to #TelAviv paid $100 from a third suitcase which didn't even make it on the plane! Besides for the impolite service...
568,United,@United  My bag is still in Colo Springs. I am disabled and have to search an unfamiliar airport and look for my bag. Not a good outcome
569,United,@united Shame that there's no flex to tickets transfer rules.  Even calling from Neurosurgery ICU isn't enough!
570,United,@united No. Denver said they don't handle baggage that made it to Colo. Springs.  They gave me an 800 number to call. No help there either.
571,United,@united you guys need some serious training in customer service. Too many better options to put up with the way you guys handle ur mistakes
572,United,@united 6533 ORD to DCA
573,United,"@united once he found out we had a problem he avoided me like the plague. Was told ""we can't find a supervisor."""
574,United,@united ZCC82U Cancelled Flight flight 16h in advance??? Need connect flight reschedule so the link isn't helping. Help!? Gf waited months to see me.
575,United,@united I will not be flying you again
576,United,"@united in addition, my first flight was delayed an hour and I'm arriving at my destination 8 hrs Late Flight."
577,United,"@united Cancelled Flighted our flight, didn't rebook us on added flight, now have to drive from a Denver to KC....thanks!"
578,United,@united your announcement for pre boarding only addresses mobility. My disability requires me to travel with a lot of stuff. Do I preboard?
579,United,@united I flew United last month and the experience was AWESOME!
580,United,@united our travel booked thru United group dept. Okc ticket agent less than willing to help with our connection in LAX.
581,United,"@united v upset with your disability  ""services"". When I told one of your employees I was carrying medical equipment she was very rude."
582,United,@united thnx for quick reply but don't think you can assist. Our intl grp will be put to considerable inconvenience today.
583,United,@united wont transfer flight ticket to accompany an 11 yr old who's active military mom had to have emergency brain surgery? WOW!!
584,United,@united @getmeontop 7 WEEKS Late FlightR AND I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY MILES FROM THE MileagePlus Gift Card $150 STARBUCKS CARD I HANDED OVER!!!
585,United,"@united as a 1k, I'm always hoping for improvement."
586,United,@united not yet. I complained about the guy who checked my luggage in as he was throwing the bags around. Unfortunate coincidence I hope?
587,United,@united OKC ticket agent Roger McLarren(sp?) LESS than helpful with our Intl group travel problems Can't find a supervisor for help.
588,United,@united mobile apps need construction from the ground up for each OS category.  It's expensive to get right .
589,United,@united another fail for the United ticket agents in OKC. LESS than helpful and could care less about our problems. American here we come.
590,United,"@united 441, which also had 1 working WC in coach. Good thing this bird landed ahead of schedule. I have to use the WC stat."
591,United,@united the os isn't controlled by me but rather @VerizonWireless .  App is new.
592,United,"@united I just sent an email to Customer Care, telling them I may have to break up with you üò¢. I sincerely hope they can help me!!"
593,United,@united silly I'm flying delta today. Your united club staff and attendants are surly and unhelpful and always seem bothered by pesky folk
594,United,@united What is your phone number. I can't find who to call about a flight reservation.
595,United,"@united well, you can't fix me missing my buddies 30th bday because of negligence but you can attempt to make up for it."
596,United,"@united why am I to believe they will help when customer service couldn't? Like I said, I want a number to someone who can fix what you did."
597,United,@united they helped me at the baggage service desk.  Said bc TSA screening was down in FLL not all bags made it but bag will be in EWR @ 12
598,United,@united Mobile boarding pass disappeared from phone while standing in line to board. Second time this week... Hmm.
599,United,@united for the record- Rozana at Newark was lovely and helpful. #choosekind

601,United,@united thx for update
602,United,@united thank you !
603,United,@united dm these nuts
604,United,@united Had to explain to a very over eager flight attendant trying to ask about my vision that my @ccicanine was not a guide dog!
605,United,@united what's the point of asking for details about a #servicedog when you book if your flight crew doesn't read them? (Continued)
606,United,@united I tried but no one was available in bogota and everyone was rude in Houston. I was stuck for 35 hours because of you guys
607,United,@united #worst2unitedflightsever UA 236 LAS to IAD 2/24 mechanical problems again - took off - had to land for fix - delayed again #wtfodds!
608,United,@united despite my bag not making it to Newark good informative email tracking updates help!

613,United,@united thanks for the info I already knew...
614,United,@united Airline trouble this winter &amp; not getting good customer service? contact http://t.co/aQjn4HwNaC  we negotiate resolutions for You!
615,United,@united on 768 to Logan - boarding gong show due to lax carry on enforcement. Bins full of coats = no room for bags. U need a better system!
616,United,@united Thank you.
617,United,@united Blackmailed me into paying ¬£130 extra or having my return ticket nullified in San Francisco Airport. Terrible service from rep #scam
618,United,@united is there an email address I can reach? Too long for a DM.
619,United,@united disappointed that u didnt honor my $100 credit given to me for ur mistakes. Taking my business elsewhere  ‚úåÔ∏èout.
620,United,@united ua1673 still waiting! Supposed to depart 9:08
621,United,@united it was credit from my last trip that never came in the mail!
622,United,@united ok it's now been 7 months waiting to hear from airline. I gave them quite a bit more than the 30 days requested! Terrible service
623,United,@united does this process ever end? Still waiting for the reply since 2 months #pathetic #customerservice
624,United,@united What's going on with your website? I'm Flight Booking Problems three tickets today and I've been booted off the system umpteen times.
625,United,@united how do I get my account number if your website says email is unavailable?
626,United,@united So do I need to book two one ways in order for her to fly as an unaccompanied minor?
627,United,"@united I received 1 bag last night, I am still missing the other one."
628,United,"@united @simonroesner you'll need to upgrade the seats too, even in economy plus it's like sitting on a concrete bench."
629,United,@united Pls Help Baby Hannah get the life saving surgeries she requires.She needs your help.Pls Donate/RT http://t.co/kQnrrP86A5
630,United,"@united bet you wont honour them, like mine ey"
631,United,@united 2nd flight also delayed no pilots! But they boarded is so we can just sit here! #scheduling
632,United,"@united I guess that's too much ask, huh?"
633,United,@united but it's hard to stay upset at someone when they at least TRY to show remorse.
634,United,"@united By the way, a simple apology goes a long way, even if it's a hollow one. It's obvious that you don't care about me or my well-being,"
635,United,@united This isn't a one time thing either! It's a shocking pattern of repeated neglect and disrespect.
636,United,@united Fingers crossed &amp; its all intact. Very disappointed with this experience as before this we were actually saying we enjoyed using you
637,United,"@united It's an incredibly easy fix, but you would rather stay in your comfort zone, while I get forced out of mine."
638,United,@united ours in July. You have ZERO excuses for this. You have an out-of-date system that causes problems like this.
639,United,@united Everyone around us is sitting with their friends and family members. They booked their tickets in October and December. We bought
640,United,@united Not sure what you are talking about. She is going on nonstop flights. SNA to SFO and then SFO to EWR.
641,United,".@united it will be because I'm moving to @AmericanAir because of @united talk, no service"
642,United,@united please be good to me this weekend!
643,United,"@united I asked a legitimate question about systemwide vs. localized problems, and got back an unreLate Flightd copy/paste. You can do better."
644,United,@united what time? Who can I call. I need my skis. I will go to the airport and get them. No more faith in United.
645,United,@united I see you guys are at it again. Amazing how one company continually makes mistakes yet fails to be held accountable for their error
646,United,@united A Tourist Wonder: Super Tides and Tide of the Century at French and U.K coasts: http://t.co/gXdqORtsS0
647,United,@united Yeah sorry but there's always a problem with United. And you have an international reputation for having problems.
648,United,@united yall should probably work on that.
649,United,"@united but then again, maybe the @BBBNE_SD_KS_IA would care more to hear what went on than whoever listens to issues you caused"
650,United,@united I wonder if sharing all this on FB and insta would produce a number. 140 characters really limits my story telling.
651,United,@united so you're telling me there is no number to call after being left in an airport because of a negligent pilot and staff?
652,United,@united Could this email be resent as it doesnt appear to have arrived.
653,United,@united yes please! Trying to get to POP- in Newark now....
654,United,@united you have to follow me in order for me to DM...come on now
655,United,"@united $25 United coupon to make up for broken entertainment system on a 9-hour flight, seriously? #Ridiculousness #learncustomerservice"
656,United,@united So they didn't drop my bag overnight &amp; now I'm leaving for a week. This is why you were supposed to hold on to the bag....
657,United,@united I did DM the details but still no response. I have to book today.
658,United,@united I know this is probably a no but is there a way to get a cheaper airfare ticket if the flight is leaving in a few hours? üôè
659,United,@united can someone please explain the process of of what happens to property found on a plane after passengers leave at Heathrow ?
660,United,@united not able to DM you my confirmation number
661,United,"@united I've sent the message, let me know if you got it. I'm not very twitter-literate. Also, is he REALLY going to be stuck for 18hrs?"
662,United,@united very unhappy at no response to complaint emailed on 2nd Feb ref.8441639. Awful customer service!
663,United,@united DM does not work what do I do?
664,United,@united private jet would have been cool! Do does not work. I'll try again

673,United,@united I'm so frustrated and nervous because of this.
674,United,@united are the ones who make it difficult for me.
675,United,@united I'm not a child. I'm someone who has an issue with flying and prepares ahead of time to reduce the distress caused by planes. You
676,United,@united how does it get Cancelled Flightled 10 hours before take off?
677,United,"@united This ALWAYS happens with you guys, and it makes traveling incredibly stressful and uncomfortable. Is that good business to you?"
678,United,@united So what does someone with severe anxiety do when the one person who can help him isn't next to him?
679,United,@united I'm seeking to go 2 client. B/c u cant get me there I need refund. I filled out form not confident it works if past is an indication
680,United,.Thnx for the response @united bot. It seems this 'improvement' could be easily attained. Is your 1st Class service really only worth $50?
681,United,"@united has unrivalled access to #California with flights to the U.S. from 7 UK airports, with nonstop or one-stop connections year-round"
682,United,"@united booked award tix on ThaiAirways but I'm not seeing a conf# for them, just the United Flight Booking Problems#. Can you get get the Thai# for me?"
683,United,@united Luckily I made my flights this time but was so disappointed with the lack of communication :(
684,United,@united checking to see why flight 3466 (atl-ord) got Cancelled Flighted?
685,United,@united service so far has been horrid. We wanted to end the trip on a high note. Guess that's not an option.
686,United,@united Booked a flight home over 7 months ago and requested seats together for my fianc√©e and I. We got 2 middle seats. UNACCEPTABLE. The
687,United,@united YOU GUYS ARE HORRIBLE.
688,United,@united thnx for the info
689,United,@united Why do I have to pay $ 17 for wifi with an international business ticket?  #pennypincher
690,United,"@united ok. To top things off, you've lost my luggage. Could you get ANY worse??? #UnitedAirlines"
691,United,@united kudos for not Cancelled Flightling flights from DFW this morning.   United usually first to panic...
692,United,@united AND my luggage has been broken!! #youcouldntmakethis up #brokenwheel
693,United,@united is flight 587 from DFW to ORD currently on-time? I see an advisory that DFW may be affected by weather
694,United,@united maybe one day you'll be the one quoted on http://t.co/mJkpgVXmPC
695,United,@United flight delayed-no one remembered to turn the heat on flight 559 leaving ORD-seriously???
696,United,@united another awesome new plane flight 1584 and extremely nice Captain Steve Connolly.
697,United,@united to speak to a real person to get this resolved politely and efficiently. (2/2)
698,United,"@united I hadn't filed a refund claim as I was told there was no charge by your DM. This is disputed by my bank, hence why I would like(1/2)"
699,United,@united did  bags make it on the flight out of iad? second day without clothes is pretty inconvenient. We're pretty curious #UnitedAirlines
700,United,@united Every United flight between Saipan and Guam is an adventure! You never know when @CapeAir's old plane will be operational :)
701,United,@united hence why I've been asking for the customer service phone number so I can speak to a real person to get this sorted out
702,United,@united did our bags leave Washington yet? That would be convenient seeing as we left there a day ago. #UnitedAirlines #lostluggage
703,United,@united so if I'm flying 1st class just one leg to Chicago but not on my long flight to China am I still able to use the lounge in Chicago
704,United,"@united according to your DMs, I'm not owed a refund. please may I be provided with a contact number before I go to my bank to file claim"
705,United,@united about 3 hours ago. I need to work out if my bag can make it to my hotel here in time or if it will need to go elsewhere.
706,United,@united Okay thank you
707,United,@united I've filed the claim but have no way of calling for updates. Is there another way to do this?
708,United,@united pls properly train your agents. Requested to speak to 1k customer service &amp; was transferred to a dead end. Not even open at this hr
709,United,@united Thanks for remembering to load my bag onto my connecting flight. Oh wait you forgot. Iceland should be fun with no clothes....
710,United,@united Thank you for the cheese platter and abundance of entertainment options. Time just flew by.
711,United,"@united customer service is atrocious! You have disrupted my travel plans, you have lost my luggage and it is impossible to TALK TO A HUMAN"
712,United,@united terminal at MIA should have food open before 5am esp when there are flights at 6am. Two hours early like recommended. Can't eat.
713,United,@united it was UA flight 1001! Now I'm currently stuck in Portland because I missed my ride because of the 3 hour delay. #GetMartyHome
714,United,"@united has not responded to my various requests for contact numbers, does anyone know the UK customer service number for #UnitedAirlines"
715,United,@united how we looking on getting those bags to Lusaka
716,United,@united Could you update me on the suitcase please? The online and phone tracking told me nothing. I was told I'd have it back yesterday!
717,United,@united thank you. Been trying for two days to set this up.
718,United,@united just 1 last thing. U guys shouldn't be charging $ for drinks on a transatlantic flight
719,United,@united LHR arrival lounge #fail. Waited 20 mins for shower then left to find hotel. U know how many passengers u carry. Planning???
720,United,@united Any luck with finalizing my reservation? I DM'd information to you. Please let me know what else you need. Want to confirm ASAP. Thx
721,United,@united completed form but doubt it's any use. UA doesn't care. 6 day vacation will now be 5. Sure UA won't feel responsibility for that...
722,United,@united Definitely a compliment! I really thought my bag was lost after it was sent on to another airport. In the end I am a happy customer
723,United,@united thanx so much. You followed through and emailed me a $1000 ticket voucher. #unitedairlines they do care
724,United,"@united this will definitely be a trip to remember EWR-STI second of the season, first on seat 35A because it pays to be loyal!"
725,United,"@united nope, they told us it was time for them to go home and to sleep at the airport. Even though they assured us we would get a room..."
726,United,@united keep me updated. Let me know that the bags make the flight to j-burg
727,United,"@united ..back for the expensive holiday, he worked all year to pay for, that you RUINED! We want compensation &amp; his original case back!"
728,United,@united thanks United I understand that. But he would actually like his own bag back! What have you done with it?! He also wants the money..
729,United,"@united frankly worse customer service ever. Problems will happen, how you deal defines a company. Never again United."
730,United,"@united It's still a valid flight. Just seems strange to delay for Late Flight inbound crew,  7 hours from now, when the plane is already here."
731,United,@united Thanks for the lack of help and the canned response from the 1K desk!
732,United,@united   It's too bad UA has had another unforeseeable operational issue on my return flight.
733,United,@united I would like to know what's going on before his current flight lands.
734,United,@united if I pay you $25 and $35 for my luggage to be delivered when I arrive. Why should I have to wait 3 additional days for its delivery?
735,United,@united so 8 hotels for 32 people but feel like we are being held hostage because someone has our boarding passes so we can't leave! #FAIL
736,United,@united you are one great airline ‚ù§Ô∏è
737,United,@united Outbound 2 bags 70 lbs bags Returning home 1 bag 50 lbs. What is your logic? And WHY? Am I writing to a Machine? Human HELP required
738,United,@lindaSWC @united:  We don't like to hear you had a poor experience. Please share details w/our Customer Care team http://t.co/HIsc4NdMgZ.
739,United,@united no Cancelled Flightn just left us to fend for ourselves when flt came in Late Flight. Getting runaround for 3 hrs. Each employee blaming  previous 1.
740,United,@united This is NOT a local UNITED number for Malaysia   0011 800-55558000. What is your local United Airlines here in Kuala Lumpur ( KUL )?
741,United,@united okay ase24766m. Find our luggage.
742,United,@united The agent that met us at the gate said any issues w/delays on UA1116 would have to be taken up online...
743,United,"@united I send you an urgent message via eservice@united.com.  BG0KWM   Narayanan. Please respond ASAP. Also, NO local United Tel # @ KUL"
744,United,@united thanks! Will you guys be getting the A380s anytime soon?
745,United,@united But they are not... lady one phone says its in tel aviv. Tel Aviv united says its in Newark. No one knows and I have nothing...
746,United,‚Äú@united: @MelanieSpring We'll see what we can do. ^KN‚Äù We are running! Most of this plane is running. Thanks for the help!
747,United,"@united yes, but still now answers. Many have not had their luggage for 3 days! Unacceptable!!"
748,United,@united what is that going to do for you? Nothing just like you always do
749,United,@united I sent in my feedback.  Thank you.
750,United,@united plus what about food? And taxis?
751,United,@united you are offering us 8 rooms for 32 people #FAIL
752,United,@united 32 people getting pretty tired about no action on solving the problem plus missing a day of vacation and skiing
753,United,@united The bright side would be keeping the promise that was made to me. Hope you're having a good night. Thanks.
754,United,@united yes I do.
755,United,@united I take back the comment about your team here working hard to help us A so far no solution for a hotel or food or anything #fail
756,United,@united on 4124 arriving two hours Late Flight into CLT. Now sitting on the tarmac while they move a plane from the gate. Unhappy customer.
757,United,@united airlines is the absolute worst. They have no idea what they are doing. #neveragain #UnitedAirlines
758,United,"@united Thanks; might want to fix this line: ""Our Customer Care team is currently responding to most inquiries within 7-10 business days."""
759,United,@united we just flew with United from AUS (Austin Bergstrom) to Cancun Intl. Best flight ever! The 737's are not too big... Not too small!
760,United,"@united it's frustrating, as a frequent flyer, loyal since Continental. Upgrade equals paying 3 times or more on top of purchase ticket."
761,United,@united Deep Vein thrombosis
762,United,"@united at its worse. Can't figure how to pack plane, screws up connectns then claims no hotl rooms in San Fran for stranded pax. Way to go!"
763,United,@united 4 passengers after a 2 hour delayed flight left with no hotel at the end of the night @ hou airport. Wtf??!! http://t.co/ZfqMpGXVS6
764,United,"Hey @united why does the flight from IAH to POS leave so Late Flight, and the one back to IAH so early? I rather get to POS earlier"
765,United,@united Lost bag process is broken. Agent promised they'd call &amp; hold my bag when found. Now they're waking me at 3am w/ delivery. #fail
766,United,@united the people at the counter have been very helpful. As you can see nobody is there. Flight to Austin 10:55 and still sitting here.
767,United,@united unfortunately still on the Tarmac at @fly2ohare and definitely missing my ride from @flypdx #GonnaBeALongNight
768,United,‚Äú@united: @Darquenloveli We regret to hear this. Please let us know if you need assistance. ^KN‚Äù I was finally able to secure my seat. Thx
769,United,@united what time does check in open for flight no UA80 from Manchester to Newark today ?
770,United,"@united good to know you will open the closed doors for ""premier passengers"" after safety briefings on delayed flights. #annoyed."
771,United,@united DM sent
772,United,@united yea get me to phoenix already. Delays all day with you people. It's bullshit.
773,United,"@united If it's any consolation, your staff was stellar. Just not the hour+ delays I encountered with every one of my 4 flights."
774,United,"@united flight ua3576, gate b1. And tell ray I somehow made it on to the 736 flight out of IAH and didn't have to wait for the 917 one. :)"
775,United,@united that's unfortunate. The @Tumitravel was an xmas gift and it looks like a razor ripped right through the front pocket in the picture
776,United,@united But thanks for asking
777,United,@united Lost bags. Cancelled Flightled flights. Delhi call centers. Poor United staff spread thin and stressed. You name it.
778,United,@united Yes. Doesn't make that mistake any less absurd. Doesn't change the fact that I'm very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight.
779,United,@united I'm constantly having challenges with upgrades &amp; charges. In order to prevent DVT I have to pay an addtl $180 http://t.co/xC6jQ70r7B
780,United,"@united In ORD, waited 20 min after crew members left before gate items came. Flight attendant sarcastically said good luck and walked away."
781,United,"@united Follow me back, please, and I'll happily DM you the link because I'd rather not share my travel plans publicly."
782,United,@united you too!
783,United,@united is my favorite airline.
784,United,@united seriously #fail on making strangers share a room
785,United,@united @luke_mcintosh68 nah you wouldn't
786,United,@united we needed them here asap. Will they make it on today's flight?
787,United,@united agent split up my reservation? Now can't Cancelled Flight and refund credit for 2wks? Why
788,United,@united Our vacation's going to be ruined w/ 3 days of rain. : ( The change fee for 2 of us is nearly cost of original flight. Can you help?
789,United,@united I sent the message. Let me know ASAP.
790,United,@united why would they make me share a room?
791,United,"@united tried calling too, but w/25 min phn wait means we'd miss options anyway"
792,United,@united can you ask your guys with flight 1146 to BWI to wait for us to get off a delayed flight from San Diego? Pretty please?
793,United,@united we're still waiting to find out your rep is working hard - most upset about having to wait to tomorrow pm to get to mammoth
794,United,"@united for an early flt, I think a call is appropriate. Yes, reviewed and nada avail until next day. Expect full refund"
795,United,"@united i understand, thanks"
796,United,"@united again I ask, who can I call to get this fixed? Tweeting me BS questions to stall only makes things worse. Phone number please."
797,United,@united Yo yo yo stuck on the tarmac for over 2 hours at @fly2ohare ... Going to miss my ride at @flypdx help please! #HelpImStuck #United
798,United,@united it's highly unprofessional for you to overbook a flight by 12 seats &amp;feel that I should rearrange my schedule for your mismanagement
799,United,"@united well, considering every agent before claimed they were unable to help with everything else, why waste more time to hear 'call corp'"
800,United,@united man I can't wait to book my ticket now! Thanks JP you're a life sabe
801,United,"@united Ice, which I totally understand. But when a large number of us are facing 15+ hours of time and overnight Cancelled Flightations it seems like"
802,United,@united flt 1249 Cancelled Flightled and I get email @3:30 AM? What happened to courtesy phn call? Had to book diff airline &amp; city
803,United,"@united tag numbers 0016 964012, 0016 964077, 0016 964078 - let's find these bags."
804,United,"@united better train your support staff with appropriate decorum, consider revisiting your terrible ""provide a death certificate' policy"
805,United,@united Well the bar is set low! You guys are really good at the apology game! What will change? When will u guys learn?
806,United,"@united My post was just more of disappointment.  I'm a frequent United flyer, it was a simple ??.  1 bad apple doesn't spoil the bunch."
807,United,@united you guys continue to impress me in Houston. http://t.co/cIh1qNllcM
808,United,@United I have no way of making phones calls... Need to handle via Twitter/email/web. Thank you!
809,United,@united Please help... I am in Ethiopia adopting a two year old child. Have an existing confirmation #. Need to add child to reservation.
810,United,"@united question:are there onboad 110 volt outlets in all planes? If so, where?"
811,United,@united Your website deserves a new design. #html5 FTW!
812,United,@united thanks for effing up our holidays - we're missing a full day of skiing due to your baggage team's incompetence at @FlyYOW
813,United,@united Twitter isn't letting me DM you..
814,United,@united I hope so too
815,United,@united agent helps the person in front of me.  Finishes up with them and then walks away.  The guy behind me is as shocked as I am.
816,United,@united Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry-on was apparently taken off &amp; left in Chicago. Pretty ridiculous.
817,United,@united Not encouraged that I'll have my CPAP tonight.
818,United,@united Yes. Did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it. Got an email that its found but not sched for delivery
819,United,@United an idea: monitor mileage members travel patterns enough to know when they change jobs/lose status...and make the transition easier.
820,United,@united  Delay DEN-CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this 1ker. #friendlyskies??
821,United,"@united Why tell us flight is delayed, then tell us it's on time again with 20 min to spare? Don't say it's delayed unless you're sure!"
822,United,"@united yes in Lusaka, Zambia. My guess is the bags never made the plane at IAD."
823,United,@united where is my flight voucher?
824,United,"@united Late Flight to Denver, Late Flight to Newark...let's not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. Unacceptable."
825,United,@united has once again let me down. Don't think I've ever flown with them and not had problems. Worst airline period.
826,United,@united yes I filed a claim &amp; hope to receive by luggage by 2am. Ridiculous as I had to purchase items to go to sleep &amp; no reimbursement.
827,United,@united UA938 ORD-LHR.  bags are being loaded 30min Late Flight. Frigid air into cabin! Plane feels like falling apart! Upgrade long haul fleet!
828,United,"@united Flight attendant never served me my beverage (tea), and not once checked up on me. What gives? #ua6076 #notcool"
829,United,@united load balancing system apparently down #systemwide - major impact on all #united airlines flights. Was this a #cyberattack?
830,United,@united After our unscheduled refueling stop and missing 2 connecting flights we r home n looking 4ward to our bed and a big PB&amp;J sandwich.
831,United,@united @AmericanAir spent hundreds to rectify the situation and you guys go quiet
832,United,@united UA276 sitting at EWR nearly an hour after sked.  Pilot says computers down but no clue when we will leave.  Can you help?
833,United,@united @AmericanAir so that's it? It just ends there? Come on! I traveled for literally an extra day and a half because of this!
834,United,@united Made the upgrade list. Will fly 1st tomorrow (for 40 min) for the first time ever! üôå #StatusMatchPaidOff http://t.co/ATfRKp6goY
835,United,"@united not just refunded, but for those of us who are on vacation to get a free room night to make up for making us sleep in DIA"
836,United,@united Thanks for the reminder. It's been a fun ride. http://t.co/pPVA4Rch9f
837,United,@united I received my luggage that also looked to be left in the snow when I arrived. I'm asking for all 50 people to be refunded.
838,United,@united updated A320 aircraft has wifi and device entertainment but no outlets. I don't get it. How can I charge devices?
839,United,@united was no one between the scan and inside the plane. I just asked the people in line around me where the plane was going
840,United,"@united 5 gate changes, two delays.  Even the crew thinks the airline sucks"
841,United,@united I'm very frustrated and have wasted 2 days now due to your equipment failures.
842,United,@united computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight info off the app. That's just ridiculous keep people updated!
843,United,"@united Soooo, it's been 15 days and you've offered no response. So I assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now?"
844,United,@united Terrific. Many thanks. Looking forward to being back on UA tomorrow. Had a great flight up to Vancouver.
845,United,@united Calls to 800# resulted in 2hrs of hold time &amp; 2day wait to check suspect code share fare. Nothing investigated‚Äîmy time wasted (2/2)
846,United,"@united It's taken ~3 weeks for Cust Care to respond to Case #8477733, requesting a refund for wi-fi not working. Where can I get an update?"
847,United,@united I appreciate your efforts getting me home!
848,United,@united That's correct‚ÄîI've spent hours trying to book online only to receive an error when clicking final purchase button. (1/2)
849,United,@united Today was not your finest. All could have been prevented by one gate agent advising 200 passengers.
850,United,@united  what is the real deal with the delay on flight UA 1032 from Denver to Vegas?
851,United,@united UA63 from Madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by 3 UA employees. MaryJo was rude and unhelpful.
852,United,@united system failure again = bad trend.  Software projects are like flying an airplane; there's no such thing as an emergency takeoff.
853,United,@united lots of reports of system failures delaying flights over the last week. Currently sitting on the tarmac at OGG for over an hour.
854,United,"@united rebooting Chicago dispatch system, need @pivotalcf as I'm tired of sitting on planes"
855,United,"@united despite shaky connections, looks like I'll get home tonight. Great job, @united - was touch and go for a while.."
856,United,"@united http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn, however, is completely under your control‚Äîthe price was and still is displayed on http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn."
857,United,@united the aircraft closest to gate was for the other flight and the one closest to our gate was going to Chicago.
858,United,@united can you tell me how to file a claim for clothing that had to be purchased?
859,United,@united comically on the return flight from ASE there were two United flights boarding at adjacent gates and not clear which plane to board
860,United,@united GRK13575M is the file reference
861,United,@united we would...how do I contact you to discuss? A few poor experiences with customer service but would give it a shot!
862,United,"@united UA 746. Pacific Rim and Date Night cut out. Not constantly or randomly, but one spot, repeatably."
863,United,@united Been trying since 1230 to file a report.
864,United,@united I send an email about my bad experience and you send back a generic response.  Yet another reason why I'll never fly with you again.
865,United,@united My mom left her Kindle on flight 1544 today. Burgundy case with a light. Seat 27D. Did anyone find it?
866,United,@united here is the ticket # 0162424965446 please refund my unnecessary upgrade fee
867,United,"@united is horrible!! They lost our carseat and expect us to use a loner carseat, safety regulations say it's illegal to use a used car seat"
868,United,@united thank you.

872,United,@united Do you have any flights with lie flat seating from STL to PDX around the date of March 5?
873,United,"@united He needs to get to home the 24th, they're telling him it'll be the 25th @ night. Is there compensation or anything that can be done?"

883,United,@united I left my comment with customer care. Thanks for contacting me.

898,United,@united how is Mexico not international from the us?
899,United,@united diverted and missed our connecting flight. Was just told that my bag is on it's way to MSY. If you only had people that cared
900,United,@united Male agnt in LAS threatens Canadian cust when cust takes pic of him at gate after agents announce can't help rebook. #friendlyskies?
901,United,@united @Apollochplayers we just want to go home tonight - why did you Cancelled Flight the last leg of our reserv. w/out our permission??! #PH6RPS
902,United,@united  Stressed and rude agents. Overwhelmed by delyd flight LAS-DEN 1657. Yelling at several people. Not pretty. This is #friendlyskies??
903,United,@united landed in Boston at 9 last night.  The 15 hours of traveling was rough tho.
904,United,@united FAIL You Cancelled Flightled our flight frm GJT and then used our reserv home to IAH (from SEA) for reFlight Booking Problems w/out OUR PERMISSION!! #PH6RPS
905,United,Just sent thank u RT @united: @goodenufmother Please DM your confirmation number if reFlight Booking Problems is needed. Thank you. ^EY
906,United,@united has made my no fly list. Other airlines wait when connector Late Flight. Stuck in IAH.
907,United,@United so what‚Äôs the deal? Do u provide voucher for overnight or am I cozy on the floor at #OHare ? #gross #HelpMePlease #AnyoneThere
908,United,"@united also, the mere fact that I have to go online to issue a statement vice calling and talking to some directly is one good example."
909,United,@united thank you. I flew into Newark from Vail/Eagle.
910,United,@united  i have a weekend of dealing with your company that would say otherwise.
911,United,@United now what?!? http://t.co/5hpSqVRjK8 flight was gone when I got off plane! #BusinessTravel #goodenoughmother
912,United,"@united the proper response: sorry for your wait, what flight # were you on so we can look into the issue. That's how @Delta would handle."
913,United,@united your customer service is terrible! Stood inline 3 hours no flights and 4 hours Late Flightr still no bag#disgutedindenver
914,United,@united please upload the March on-demand entertainment listing on your website! ‚úàÔ∏è

918,United,@united boarding time shows 35 min and your gate agent started at 45. showed up at 4:00 and they had to check bag. http://t.co/zCBJyo6lsN
919,United,@united Agent in LAS letting 20 customers know they can't help them rebook delayed flight to DEN #unfriendlyskies http://t.co/QuzVmK2rTR
920,United,@united empathizes w/ my disappointment that 1stClass flight w/nonworking entertainmnt is worth $50. #UnFriendlySkies http://t.co/lOecO4gmvd
921,United,@united ...and when that doesn't work...
922,United,"@united did you have seen my message today?? About a mcdonnell Douglas dc 10 model?? I will hear it if you read it, Goodnight now"
923,United,@united searched for mileage tickets to BOM couldn't find a single one is saver awards - I see how you play.  Earn miles but can't use them.
924,United,"@united flight arrives 30 minutes early, but then have we to wait for an hour for our bags."
925,United,@united That's not the issue. The fact that no one even called (despite promises) to confirm the bag's location is.
926,United,@united what's a girl gotta do to get a flight name change when SHE bought one for a mean ex boyfriend and needs a girl's trip stat?!
927,United,@united thank you. We are signed up for notifications. We shall watch and wait! ‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è
928,United,@united still waiting to hear back. My wallet was stolen from one of your planes so would appreciate a resolution here
929,United,@united I would love if someone could get me back to Austin tonight and I do not wish to wait til tomorrow morning.
930,United,@united or @flysaa has lost my baggage‚Ä¶ heard different things from different employees of @united. @flysaa has said nothing.
931,United,"@united cs thinks that miles can repair the damage done, it will be interesting if they travel in @united and exp the worst flight ever!"
932,United,@united I have a 0530 flight out of DFW on Tuesday. How far in advance will you give notice if Cancelled Flightled?
933,United,@united I am signed up for notifications. This is the first trip I was not updated on. Not sure why this happened.
934,United,@united Thank you. Took care of everything and made it right. That's the experience I'm used to. Opened the app to find flight changed.
935,United,@united that is not in line with your responses here. And now I'm waiting until tomorrow morning because all the flights are overbooked.
936,United,"@united I took the exact same aircraft in to LAX 3 days ago. It fit, no problem. The agent today told some nonsense about a policy change"
937,United,@united your helpful agents in Club helped.  I am just out baggage fees and a night of my life.stop doing business with @SilverAirways
938,United,@United never heard of this? http://t.co/QDebyaHqfM
939,United,"@SouthwestAir doesn't charge ticket change fees. Do they not incur the same mysterious ""costs"" that you incur, @united?"
940,United,@united Exhausted &amp; frustrated! Link to a FB post abt my travel issue https://t.co/LaRKC8vc4s
941,United,@united I was denied getting on the plane w/o getting the chance to prove it fits. I'm not a rookie. Read my bio.
942,United,@united that's exactly the point. It fits. I'm premier access. Boarding group 2. This was a return ticket. I've been doing this for 15 yrs
943,United,@united I've never experienced worst customer service. Placing blame on codeshare partners and not assuming responsibility is unacceptable
944,United,@united currently on board so not now. Check in was terrible. Staff rude. Expensive luggage thrown around etc.
945,United,"@United fucked up, then voided my ticket, and KEPT MY MONEY.  Not even an apology. I will never fly with your airline again. #UnitedAirlines"
946,United,@united has the WORST customer svcs! This Kevin rep at call center must be investigated. My baggage's lost and there's no help but argument!
947,United,@united should NOT sell tickets for @SilverAirways on http://t.co/onhXHCO6bK.  has terrible service and UA staff cannot reach Silver
948,United,"@united Just got demoted from Gold cuz my hubby got 100% of the PQD, tho there were enuf $ spent for 4 Golds.#spousal.discrimination/angry."
949,United,@united Thank you!
950,United,@united When will direct flights from Belfast Intl to Newark resume from their winter break? Thanks.
951,United,@united My favorite way to travel! Thank you! http://t.co/vGN2X1ckg0
952,United,"@united yes, after this awful weather it appears I can get home"
953,United,@united yes lots. You have terrible customer service at Newark and despite raising a complaint there we were ignored hence the tweet
954,United,@united Lovely new plane from LGA to ORD but no power outlets?
955,United,"@united but if i tweet the ID number, won't that reveal my home address to anyone on the web?"
956,United,@united I filed a delayed bag report on Saturday! my flight was Cancelled Flightled and I never went anywhere!
957,United,@united the person is currently bettween gates 71A and 73 in LAX
958,United,@united i need it there before she lands so she can have the EWR baggage claim file to have it sent but the employee has not droppeditoffyet
959,United,"@united rarely ceases to amaze...for the worse.  i hope this is the last time i ""have"" to fly with you."
960,United,@united thank you for the quick response but I cannot dm you until you follow me as well
961,United,@united iCloud it is not there yet -- PLEASE HELP 917 703 1472
962,United,"@united I need the phone number to baggage claim in LAX, my mom left her phone and someone called saying they would put it there but on"
963,United,@united I did... no response back
964,United,@united this is atrocious customer service.
965,United,"@United will not have to honor absurdly low mistake fares.
http://t.co/2Z3Jv73IlW v√≠a @usatoday"
966,United,@united #albanyairport delayed departure to check bags at gate claiming space filled and walk on to open spaces a delay #poorcustomerservice
967,United,@united you Cancelled Flighted our flights for no reason &amp; now we have been on the phone for AN HOUR on our vacation. Why?
968,United,@united @dfpietra THAT'S your response?  Shaking my head back and forth with a tsk. You can do better-from customer service to your apology
969,United,"@united thanks! It's 35K miles from RTB to Europe, to do a multiple destination so we could stop over in US on way/way back- mileage diff?"
970,United,@united of course I did. The bag should be here by now :( #frustrated
971,United,@united you are the worst. I will avoid you like the plague.
972,United,@united is the worst airline in the world.
973,United,@united someone needs to DM me and resolve this correctly. Extremely disappointed with the service I received. Terrible management.
974,United,@united Premier Gold desk changes flight. Waives fees. Gives me wrong flight. Now Jana Acosta in Salt Lake refuses the same service. Angry.
975,United,"@united I will give you one thing, you are consistent but unfortunately you are consistent at not doing your job well #AlwaysDelayedOnUnited"
976,United,@united I will but right now I'm to angry
977,United,@united first time flying with United. Also last time. #terrible back to @VirginAtlantic for me. #branson #virginatlantic #UnitedAirlines
978,United,@united I used to be a committed #ContinentalAirlines flyer until merger. I remember now why I switched to @SouthwestAir #CommunicationFail
979,United,@united the least you could do is offer me a ticket in coach instead of just Cancelled Flighting my reservation because of your glitch!!! #notfair
980,United,"@united I'm saying I made the flight but with poor/non-communication, unaccounted for lost time &amp; lots of frustrated flyers standing around"
981,United,@united I think DM would be better
982,United,@United gate announcement states delay due to maintenance yet app says Late Flight arriving aircraft  tell the truth! @unfriendly
983,United,@united you are easily the worst company I have ever experienced. You have lost someone's personal possessions &amp; you couldn't care less!....
984,United,@united how can your app show arriving aircraft is early but departing flight is delayed due to Late Flight arriving aircraft? @unfriendly
985,United,@united already did that at the airport and 12 hrs Late Flightr its still not here! you guys are really killing me today. trying to stay positive..
986,United,@united once united's service levels reaches those of Etihad or lets be more realistically Lufthansa then ill consider it again
987,United,@united really?  Someone called in sick and then someone FORGOT to call a replacement?!  Now an hour Late Flight to take off. #theworst
988,United,@united Asked Flight attendant what typical compensation would be &amp; says we might get free TV. #Unacceptable
989,United,@united done
990,United,"@united Thank you, ^JH, appreciate the prompt responses--me and other passengers will be doing so."
991,United,@united has been such a disappointment today. Simply put. Rather unpleased with things currently. Flight delayed; cant wait to just get home
992,United,"@united During the same round trip, my NON-English speaking friend was stranded TWICE for 12+ hours each time! Most staff members were rude."
993,United,"@united  found a group of people who actually hates people more than ISIS, thats right United Airlines."
994,United,"@united Nope. Walked up &amp; down the ORF terminal, &amp; not a United agent to be found. Showed up @ last minute to board us. Many panicked people"
995,United,@united thank you
996,United,@united by the time I finally get to Dallas I could have driven with less frustration and cheaper.
997,United,"@united I'm trying to get to my final destination, we need compensation. Just about 2hrs of personal time wasted."
998,United,@united that guy really has no customer service clue.Could have spent effort clearing bins for rollerboards instead of art projects in mine!
999,United,@united he has no priority and Iove it
1000,United,@united Pleased to be a Premier Platinum
1001,United,@united how can you not put my bag on plane to Seattle. Flight 1212. Waiting  in line to talk to someone about my bag. Status should matter.
1002,United,"@united @campilley hahaha. If they weren't an American company, i would say this was great sarcasm!!"
1003,United,@united i think he actually did not like your screen  @campilley üòÉüòÉüòÉ
1004,United,@united Apparently they are asking 20 people to off board the plane--how can such a big miscalculation be made?!
1005,United,@united It's a shame choosing #United may be the difference between reuniting with aging friends and never seeing them again #PoorService
1006,United,"@united hi guys, do you have a general enquires email address please? Thanks David."
1007,United,@united Just checking in again - what is the status of our claim.   It is going on 2 months with no attention to this?   We are very upset.
1008,United,@united my flight was delayed due to maintenance in LIT and caused me to miss my connection at IAH to MSY. Can you help?
1009,United,@united #UnitedAirlines Pls Fix #AspenBaggageFail issues. Had to pay my own way to #Aspen after flight Cancelled Flight. Left us in the cold in DEN.
1010,United,@united Read my bio. See who I work with. I have NEVER encountered this with your airline before. Disappointed is an understatement.
1011,United,@united Does customer care have email or a phone rep that I can speak with? We had so many issues they can't be placed in 2000 characters?
1012,United,Thank you ‚Äú@united: @TRUU_Tall I can certainly take a look. Please follow and DM me your confirmation number for assistance. ^JH‚Äù
1013,United,@united In the process of recovering their car rental - condo rental $ in Florida. They called #United for an alternate flight #NOANSWER
1014,United,"@united I am buying 2 yo own seat on 3 legs of intl trip, car seat? Required? If not- then allowed? Can child still sit w/mom after takeoff?"
1015,United,@united thanks for listening! I definitely was not the only person in line who thought it was absurd.
1016,United,@United We've been waiting on tarmac for &gt;1hr because apparently UA1116 is overweight &amp; we returned to gate. #WTF #fb
1017,United,"@united Thank you. Mention that before I boarded she asked 1other person to measure their bag, and it was another woman. Men not asked."
1018,United,@united Can't leave the Tarmac ..united's gate agent cannot agree on a head count. 20 min now counting a 100 people max #epicfailunited
1019,United,@united That's real dedication &amp; concern. Your apologies don't fix the issue nor any of the miserable issues I've had over the past 6 mos.
1020,United,@United blocked me from DM'ing them because they would rather I complain about them in a public forum
1021,United,@united ok. I just submitted. Thanks for the opportunity to give feedback.
1022,United,@united Big thanks to Ms. Winston for assisting me over the phone with a baggage claim issue today. She really went the extra mile!
1023,United,"@united I will, as soon as I am done with my article.  Thanks!  ~Tom"
1024,United,@united booked flights for 2 for $779. Was charged $389.50 twice. Means I can't redeem CC points properly. Would have gone elsewhere.
1025,United,@united We've had a ton of problems with getting our bags and have been given the run around for a day. Whats up with that?
1026,United,@united pedophile airline. Split myself and my 10 yr old daughter rows apart on flight 1254 to boston
1027,United,@united have been waiting 2 days for my military bags from an airport 3 hours away from me. Horrible.
1028,United,"@united Arriving 25 minutes early is nice, but not if equipment isn't ready. Waiting 30 minutes for luggage, so far. Time gains wiped out."
1029,United,@united is doing musicians real dirty at LAX. I've never been blocked from getting on a flight with my bass.
1030,United,"@united I'm rebooked now, but the line was 300 people deep."
1031,United,.@united For those playing along at home: http://t.co/2b4bDTldX2
1032,United,"@united @FlyEIA yes, they said it took more than an hour!"
1033,United,@united those whose pay to actually fly with you over 30k/ year deserve better service than a CC holder.
1034,United,@united Ok thank again for your help!
1035,United,@united Not a happy flyer.  UA flight 1161 from SFO to Cleveland.  Sunday 2/22.  Stay tuned for blog article from http://t.co/VdFdODqVGx
1036,United,Thanks @united. @imran_r44 had a question about the wait time for baggage on UA6366
1037,United,@united flight 1491...plane from SFO to DEN is basically on time.
1038,United,@united thanks. Just a program comment; the system assigned seats behind each other even though pairs were available. I changed it back.
1039,United,@united 20 min more delays to flt 2086 at sfo 2 load 2 more pax makes no sense. Will strand many of us overnight at ORD due to missed cnxns
1040,United,"@united Heads up We didn't check 8 bags, 2 we checked arrived, those aren't claim #s for our 2. Other people's bags? http://t.co/dplQ3mhQGD"
1041,United,"@united This must be a drone ‚Äú@united: @KeamBleam We understand your frustration. Our Bag team is working hard to get your bag(s) to you..."""
1042,United,"@united Change made in just over 3 hours. For something that should have taken seconds online, I am not thrilled. Loved the agent, though."
1043,United,@united flight attendant doesn‚Äôt understand not understanding English doesn‚Äôt mean they are deaf. Stop yelling English slowly to them.
1044,United,"@united Not appropriate to ask in public (hence the dm). each united employee, each a new answer. your process was such a hassle i Cancelled Flighted."
1045,United,@united well that's big of you but I don't have terribly high expectations at this point.
1046,United,@united it's like you're trying to make me hate your airline. Fee for each checked bag that's never mentioned in the ticket + rude agents üëø
1047,United,"@united nice your app says US 4972 delayed by weather.  Pilot says waiting on fuel.  One in ur control, one not"
1048,United,@united Please than Robin at EWR Premiere Desk for helping me get on a an earlier flight. She did the work.  Huge thanks.
1049,United,"@united Ok thank you, do you provide complimentary hotel accommodations since I'll have to stay overnight?"
1050,United,@united I was originally trying to share details but the link Jimmy Samartzis Vice President - Customer Experience sent me expired.
1051,United,"@united really? 3 hr delay, 4 gate changes, &amp; you boarded us, sent us back up, &amp; boarded us again.  Won't change our flight. Can we go now?"
1052,United,"@united that would help! or how about integrate it into the App so I can just ""activate"" it and surf..."
1053,United,@united I did. The AC went on for about 20 minutes before returning to the Mojave Desert. #PressureCooker #HeatTrap
1054,United,@united Nope - still no one helped me.  Giving up on united. #badservice
1055,United,"@united 8602947, jon at http://t.co/58tuTgli0D, thanks."
1056,United,@united when an airline causes the missed connection u would think they would take whatever steps to remedy that screw up.
1057,United,@united I'd thank you - but you didn't help.  taking 6 hours to reply (so I get a message in the middle of the night) isn't actually helpful
1058,United,@united Flight UA1270 is descending into farce and we haven't left EWR yet. Is this going to get any worse?
1059,United,"@united I was told it was due to be on UA23 which flies direct to Dublin, so why did it go to London? This is a complete shambles!"
1060,United,@united 45+ min at EWR baggage claim #stillnobags #ridiculous
1061,United,Flight Booking Problems for a travel writers trip I am hosting and need to be happy when I land! Do you have the cute PJs AA does? @united
1062,United,But I don't see AA @united
1063,United,@united Did you find out where it is? Thanks
1064,United,"@united On a standby to Denver, which has been delayed, and a confirmed to Aspen, whose flights have been Cancelled Flighted all day. 0 confidence."
1065,United,@united yes at 2am...but now back on a plane again and delayed again due to baggage loading issue... http://t.co/NfAQHhr09j
1066,United,@united at what pt do u just Cancelled Flight!  Finally got stndby 4 1pm flight. What a day!  #missedWork #clientNotHappy http://t.co/sUPrLfOi8T
1067,United,@united thank YOU for your kindness. Your agents went above &amp; beyond to get my stranded family home.
1068,United,@united don't see a justifiable cost to get on an early flight with seats. No airline charges to conveniently get their passengers in early
1069,United,@united Woke up to notification- flight moved 1.5 hrs early. Barely made flight then 3 hrs layover in SFO - wanted to hop on earlier option
1070,United,"@united I will do delayed baggage claim when I land. Hopefully the bag isn't broken into, damaged or lost w/c will result in more complaints"
1071,United,"@united done. Want me to send a screen shot of the second call, which is now at over 45 minutes?"
1072,United,@united look at this beauty üòâ dc 10 united airlines üòâ http://t.co/MvYoizRPdE
1073,United,@united Thanks! I'll fill up the form as soon as I land. I don't like being duped so I hope you will appreciate my feedback &amp; will be better
1074,United,"@united, this is the line in Denver to rebook due to weather issues. DO BETTER. http://t.co/tmccExYaaQ"
1075,United,"@United the ones who suffer. I understand delays, I don't understand trying speed up a process that has been delays to this extent."
1076,United,"@united 2 Cancelled Flighted flights Late Flightr, agent claimed she put me on a new flight but then Cancelled Flighted it. Coworker got on flight- now delayed. Now?"
1077,United,"@United of urgency, but this is ridiculous. Your ceo claims to be customer focused, yet when delays happen, planes sit and customers are"
1078,United,@united I wasn't asking for a full refund but delaying me 3 hours and giving no reason should be enough to give partial credit
1079,United,"@United flight was scheduled for 11:56, it's 1:05 and we haven't moved. I have never been on a flight where everyone moved without a sense"
1080,United,@united ok thx!
1081,United,@united I can't DM you so here's the confirmation # G8CVWJ - please is there any way I can make it to Kailua tonight? Thank you
1082,United,@united go to hell
1083,United,"@united since bulkhead seats cannot have bags on floor, why don't u reserve o/head space above those seats? In 1B on UA246 - not impressed"
1084,United,@united Definitely will!
1085,United,@united Would be helpful if you could refresh boarding time info on boarding passes for delayed flights
1086,United,"@united  18 flights so far this year. 13 delays including 2 Cancelled Flightations.  Late Flightst reason, crew needed mandatory sleep. IN MEXICO!"
1087,United,@united great to hear Thankyou so much. Greatly appreciate your replies. Feel much more settled now.
1088,United,@united counter agents at RDU deserve a medal. #thankyou
1089,United,The saga of the @MelissaAFrancis bag delay w/ @United - will there be a reunion or will she be forced to go shopping? Stay tuned.
1090,United,@united Flight 211/ORD gate agent tried to prevent me from taking onboard a bag I've used for 15 years! Flight crew was more reasonable!
1091,United,@united thank you. Literally called for preboarding as I ran up.
1092,United,@united why do you guys split up the charges to credit cards? Making it unnecessarily more expensive for people to fly with you guys on pts
1093,United,"@united it was UA381 on 14 Feb. Point is, overselling flights= bad. Making people wait 1hr while you kick them off after boarding is worse"
1094,United,@united that's brilliant Thankyou so much. Is it classed as part of carryon?
1095,United,@united what gate is ua5396 leaving from?
1096,United,@united thank you for listening to my compliant and doing the right thing. I appreciate you working with me
1097,United,@united we've been here since 3am and you've Cancelled Flightled our flight twice
1098,United,@united no chance I wait in ORD all afternoon for another flight after you screwed me. Hold 5396
1099,United,@united UA5396 can wait for me. I'm on the ground trying to get to the gate after we were moved to B. This is crap.
1100,United,@united from MEX NRT (dates TBD) but I'm getting a 200 to 300 USD difference in my quotations through September when compared to MEX BKK
1101,United,@united fails again. @SouthwestAir saves the day.
1102,United,@united better just keep connection from ORD To FWA that boards in ten minutes open until I get off the plane that just landed an hour Late Flight
1103,United,@united is there a United gold number? I've been on hold 24 minutes and think I may be lost in nowhereland. Have a gold reservation. Help.
1104,United,@united Great! I'm ready to go home.
1105,United,@united wow you even answered back!  Awesome! @AmericanAir @USAirways That's customer service!!! #usairwaysfail
1106,United,@united. It's not my first time flying to the US. I have medical info. Looking for practical like my adapted seat cushion allowed on?
1107,United,@united noooooooooooooooooooooope.
1108,United,"@united Oh, we are sure it's not planned, but it occurs absolutely consistently, it's usually the only YYJ flight that's Cancelled Flightled daily."
1109,United,@united @JMS2802 : outsource it all United Airlines...your customers  are just loving you for it. Outsource. Outsource. Outsource.
1110,United,"@united Hi, Im flying SFO-LAX-SAL-CLO. My connecting time in LAX is 1h45m. Is it enough time? Do I have to collect my bag and recheck on AV?"
1111,United,@united Thank you! You need to follow back tho otherwise I can't DM you. X
1112,United,"@united it's not getting any better. I'd suggest you get a senior manager to this gate , then retrain these gate people"
1113,United,"@United States faundation was by faith Judeo Cristian,@Not it was by ideologias.@ http://t.co/mWBk68k0A3"
1114,United,@united @JMS2802 : nothing like supporting your own mechanics and maintenance workers...instead United puts out a video of TIMCO doing wifi.
1115,United,@united Just sent! Thanks :)
1116,United,@united already missed  connection ugh
1117,United,"@united @JMS2802 : sure show a video of your outsourced favorite TIMCO, who has a knack for doing substandard maintenance work on aircraft."
1118,United,@united How do I formally complain about your customer service handler who misconnected me. I was denied boarding &amp; I now lost my bag. Help!
1119,United,@united there are a lot of unhappy cold people on the bridge in freezing temps for an hour. Not given any info.
1120,United,@united flight 3763 IAd-Sat. We're on the outdoor track for an hour
1121,United,@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline w/out WiFi...and pls no 'unwind' BS.
1122,United,@united u would not be able to rebook me to get home any sooner than a now 2hr delayed flight.  #linesforever #customerservice #fail #again
1123,United,@united you're the reason this whole travel experience has been a nightmare
1124,United,@united what a pointless tweet. At least @AmericanAir asked me to follow them to try and resolve
1125,United,@united that's not even an apology
1126,United,@united that's cool - now what?
1127,United,@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline without WiFi...
1128,United,"@united, b4 boarding this attendant took his shoe &amp;sock off at the desk and showed other agents his foot. So gross. http://t.co/755VpYm4Mv"
1129,United,@United are you able to see if there are seats open on another flight??
1130,United,@united #unitedairlines so is it 6:20 pm or 12:20?   ORD ABQ 3709.   I can't even take a walk without missing a change.
1131,United,"@united Hopefully my baggage fees will be waived tomorrow when I actually get on a flight, as well as compensation for my hotel room"
1132,United,"@united Either is fine. However, plundering my hard-earned dollars is not fine."
1133,United,@united @retailbagholder hahaha. At least they gave u a refund.
1134,United,"@united your SFO-YYJ fight is Cancelled Flightled several times each week, why even bother?"
1135,United,"@united, and now while waiting for new pilot the door on plane BROKE. why am I global services status  on an airline that's unsafe? STUNNING"
1136,United,@united How do I get reimbursed for hotel and taxis for the Cancelled Flightation?
1137,United,"@united Awesome flight crew on UA1589, re the plane,  the  Jurassic period called and they want their dinosaur/plane back!"
1138,United,"@united In 2015, United is ""unable"" to look up a flight reservation by passenger name at the YYZ check-in counter - WOW smh #customerservice"
1139,United,"@united e-ticket # 0162389030167, refund request # 16866853, case id # 8465981"
1140,United,@united been on the phone for over an hour with customer service and they can't figure it out! awesome service... NOT!
1141,United,"@united
You really know how to piss people off. Your Farelock option is fake!"
1142,United,"@united, last week shanghai to sfo 858 delay 5hrs bc of engine. today sfo-sea delay to ""sick pilot"". no compensation. They Do. Not. Care."
1143,United,@united only thing confusing me is why I lost priority boarding? I'm a mileage plus card member üòî
1144,United,@united We're hoping to hear from you actually.
1145,United,"@united shes been rescheduled for today, but with the frigid cold, being a possible reason for ""maintenance"" it could be the same issue 2day"
1146,United,"@united It's the fact that an international should not be with out her bag and no sense of what's going on other than ""maintenance""."
1147,United,"@united b) I contacted you directly, and the phone service was Laissez Faire at best.  The problem isn't a Cancelled Flightled a flight."
1148,United,"@united a) she's an international. Her phone is on the fritz, I had to get to Chicago from nearly 4 hrs away to figure everything out."
1149,United,"@united sorry for the delayed response. It was UA #381 Chicago to San Fran. Held up for almost an hour on the Tarmac. Also, lost my bags"

1153,United,"@united I'd say most of the public can't extend their vacation a week, point is why advertise multiple flights you can't honor?"
1154,United,"@united Cancelled Flights flt from EWR. ""No crew"".Tells wife &amp; 4 yr old to ""get to NY to catch @AirCanada"" to YYZ! Good #customerservice is dead."
1155,United,"@united Now arriving a day and a half Late Flightr than supposed to. Lesson of the day, don't believe verbal or written confirmations from United"
1156,United,@united BUT you have received confirmation via email that you are confirmed and ticketed on this flight.
1157,United,@united Arriving at the airport 2 hours before departure time and still missing your flight bc you actually don't have an electronic ticket
1158,United,@united 1.75 hour delay.  Nothing says sorry like a voucher.  Missing time with family.  #family #precioustime
1159,United,"@united After speaking to a United customer service rep the night before a flight, confirming that everything is ok with your reservation.."
1160,United,@United has two whole people trying to schedule a flight's worth of missed connections. Shameful http://t.co/6kqLhVaP7G
1161,United,"@united is unfriendly screw family, that hates kids and moms. now waiting on  UA871... pray its better FYVRFN ..due to agent error and tickt"
1162,United,"@united  gate agent at EWR "" if you are disabled or in a wheel chair, it's time to board, please step"". STEP UP??? Lol"
1163,United,@united it won't help...been there done that.

1170,United,@united arrived in YYZ to take our flight to Taiwan. Reservation missing our ticket numbers. Slow agent Sukhdeep caused us to miss our flt.
1171,United,@united thank you!
1172,United,@united Thanks for the update.
1173,United,@united and those three people were awesome working very long hours. It is easy to say sorry on Twitter but you should help your ppl @EWR
1174,United,@united I guess. But what is the excuse for understaffed costumer services? 3 people had to deal with lots of angry passengers. Weather too?
1175,United,"@united ,now you have Cancelled Flightled my wife and daughter's flt?? What's going on? Follow me so I can dm details."
1176,United,@united Has it departed? I was awaiting an inbound plane yesterday for three hours and it never arrived. Had to stay overnight (again).
1177,United,@united #UnitedAirlines Any other way ORD to ABQ anytime within the next 7 hours?
1178,United,@united just confirmed a seat! Crisis averted! Beers won't be missed now
1179,United,@united was that English? I'll DM though I don't think you'll make a plane appear.
1180,United,@united looks like today will be my 6th consecutive delayed flight from you...do I win a prize??? @Southwest Air why don't you fly to SBA? üò≠
1181,United,@united sitting in a plane with no pilot.  Thanks! #waitingonapilot #denver #siouxfalls #whyairtravelsucks
1182,United,@united Understood and thanks! I should have tried reaching out sooner.
1183,United,@united already done that. the answer i got was... oops we can give you miles and we're very sorry. but who pays for my discomfort for 9 h?
1184,United,@united received hotel but no food.  Also email for 3750 miles.  Last trip had 3 hr delay and 5000 miles - so less for Cancelled Flightlation?
1185,United,@united Do we know why UA5282 is delayed x2)? This is getting crazy. I've already had 2 overnight delays. #UnitedAirlines
1186,United,@united follow back and I'll give you the details.
1187,United,"@united and most frustratingly, all this delay happened either at the gate, or even onboard the aircraft! No heads up in advance!!!"
1188,United,@united The DEN b44 agent (9:30am) was amazing. The MPAgent at check in? She sucks. @seanMFmadden @PeterStraubMMA @jmercadoMMA @TonySimsMMA
1189,United,"@united my UA3426 on 2/19 was also delayed by 2 hours, stretching my trip way past the midnight, extremely exhausting!"
1190,United,@united Ha‚Ä¶ you rebooked me in to an 11 hr layover &amp; are robbing me of a night with my family. Too Late Flight for that. Just fly on time for once.
1191,United,@united switched to fly united from delta for the past two trips and was very disappointed. Now my UA4646 on 2/23 is delayed by 3 hours!!
1192,United,@united traveling with @MegZezzo who is injured. Gate agent in Chicago was awesome helping her. TY #roadwarrior
1193,United,@united  #UnitedAirlines  how long will1531 be delayed.
1194,United,@united Why isn't the flight status updated to delayed UA1532 no board
1195,United,@united I paid for economy plus and you put me in the last boarding group so I have to gate check my bags too? @VirginAmerica knows better..
1196,United,@united i travelled from SCL- IHA feb 17. the AC on my sit (21L) was ON all night. I complaint to FA who never gave me a real answer. Help!
1197,United,@united you suck.    9 hour delay?!
1198,United,@united you are the worst airline in the world! From your crap website to your worthless app to your Late Flight flight. You SUCK! Just shut down.
1199,United,"@united @scotthroth scott, need a good book suggestion?"
1200,United,"@united JH, thanks so much for reaching out. I was able to get assistance after waiting for 70 minutes."
1201,United,@united 3866 is at a stand still! No pilot or paperwork for fix over 25mins! Problem was fixed 30mins ago. Flight is as is delayed!
1202,United,@united please see dm!!
1203,United,@united. Is it reasonable to wait 45 mins for the bag you made me check because the flight staff couldn't police the overhead bins?
1204,United,@united Please msg me a # for customer service. I will have an invoice for my dry cleaning but won't be able take wet clothes to the airport
1205,United,@united AN HOUR DELAY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PRINT A PIECE OF PAPER!
1206,United,@united still no response??
1207,United,@united 4 people MCI to DEL. Preferably with Jet Airways EWR-BRU-DEL segment. Anytime in December
1208,United,@united should have been able to get seat assign without paying $174 more - cust sec should have done that for me
1209,United,"@united There is no ""reference number."" Your agent told me to ""just drive to the airport"" because ""I can't reach anyone there to deliver..."""
1210,United,@united Slightly better. Crew spent a long time searching for better altitude. Would have helped to let pax in on why all the sharp drops.
1211,United,@united My credit card was charged on the transaction when I was told it would not be. If the charge goes through I will be contacting you.
1212,United,@united my PQMs and PQDs are no longer showing up correctly in my MileagePlus acct. How can I get this fixed?
1213,United,@united Thanks!

1216,United,@united I am trying to make/change reservations and getting extremely frustrated!!! Giving up and trying another airline!!!
1217,United,"@united I got email update but still no ETA. More communication/details, apology + info on compensation rights would go a long way"

1219,United,@united no they aren't - I just called to check. #WORSTCUSTOMERSERVICE
1220,United,@united passengers should have been rerouted to match the intended arrival time (even if you have to incur cost to put us in other airlines)
1221,United,"@united been solved,  they finally picked up the second time I called,  thanks for the response JH!  7:21 to dulles works!"
1222,United,"@united need to work on your #United #flierfriendly program. At the very least, clue in your flight attendants."
1223,United,@united space. Doctors' notes and everything. And on my first trip they lost my first suitcase. Among other issues- not pleased with #united

1377,United,@united 40 minutes on tarmac now. That's after 9 hour delay.
1378,United,@united I am very glad I took care of own rescheduling now that UA 1580 from OGG was Cancelled Flightled. http://t.co/H3k3oWOhD1
1379,United,@united Tried filling out the status match form and got hit with an error message. How can I tell if it went through? http://t.co/JbDkxd6eFz
1380,United,@united Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER?????????
1381,United,@united One of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes. Her tone &amp; language was very unprofessional.
1382,United,@united that's why I blame your company. Because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons
1383,United,@united I wanna be grand staff
1384,United,"@united SF crew lack a lot of customer service, LAX employees are a lot better. Wonder why..."
1385,United,@united that's why I missed my flight. If the flight had been held for 5 minutes I would have made it. I watched it pull away from the gate
1386,United,@united also didn't ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs.
1387,United,@united your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn't have a gate agent once we got a gate.
1388,United,@united I wanna be ride United airline! I love airplane
1389,United,"@united after 2 days - 1 flight Cancelled Flightled, another delay for 8 hours- united gave me a $7 food voucher. That's how much they value my time??"
1390,United,@united checked me in through security under the wrong name and given the wrong boarding pass. #AirlineSecurity
1391,United,"@united what the hell? Flight 746. Delayed since 3 pm, finally boarded and now sitting on the tarmac? Is this f&amp;&amp;%$cking plane Ever leaving?"
1392,United,"@united Actually, the flight was just Cancelled Flightled! http://t.co/Qf0Oc2HqeZ"
1393,United,"@united I am a loyal Premier Platinum member, but the lack of communication was really bad. Also, i don‚Äôt see that it has taken off yet"
1394,United,@united thanks for having changed me. Managed to arrive with only 8 hours of delay and exhausted
1395,United,"@united This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?"
1396,United,"@united If you consider 50 mins for bags @ 10:00pm on a Sunday night ""as fast as they can"", you should reconsider what you think that means."
1397,United,"@united It's the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United"
1398,United,@united why do you want me to be loyal  if don't let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead
1399,United,"@united UA flight 1247. SFO to LAX took my carry on at gate. I'm Group 2, overhead bins are empty"
1400,United,@united On top of that I paid for 1st class and my wife got stuck in coach.
1401,United,@united Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! Your employees totally suck.
1402,United,"@United Over the last week, United has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life. Disgusting. #united"
1403,United,@united 24 hrs since flight landed and ZERO info on my missing bag? rough ETA would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence
1404,United,@united big surprise #nogate waiting for our plane. Same fucken issues everything I fly you. #fail #worstairlineever
1405,United,"@united Not to belabor my point,but shouldn't I be able to put a laptop bag above my seat?  Why is it announced to leave it for rollers? Thx"
1406,United,@united maybemange the airline alittlebetter. Arrived at LAX and no GATE! #howisthatpossible always the same thing w/u
1407,United,@united I just checked my united app and the most valuable use of this app has been removed. I can no longer see the status of my equipment?
1408,United,"@united even after running to gate from your connecting flight, your customer service not let us in the plane that was just parked. Stranded"
1409,United,@united I'm desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this Cancelled Flightled/delayed flight.  #unacceptable #ORD
1410,United,"@united Nope, no more chances. Your airline messed up both ways of our trip."
1411,United,@united Why announce it is for rollers at all? If I want to put a coat in there isn't that my choice?  How about all gate checked? Thx
1412,United,@united you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016
1413,United,"@united  bags left behind because plane overweight, be great if knew as soon as we landed, instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info."
1414,United,@united You are a F&amp;$KING joke. Your customer service is woeful. If your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it!
1415,United,@united was a sponsor of the oscars? No wonder it was a half hour delayed. #Oscars
1416,United,@united Worked like a charm. Bag was waiting on the carousel when we got to baggage claim. #welldone #goodflight #friendlysky
1417,United,@united will lose my bag but won't give me free pretzels #frauds
1418,United,"@united you are trying to charge me 150 bucks because you lowered your award tickets and I want to get my hard earn points back, total BS"
1419,United,@united does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter
1420,United,@united Apart from being on hold for over 2 hours and having talked to 5 people and the problem still not resolved!
1421,United,"@united typical caned response from UA, fix your crappy performing, last placed/ranked airline in this century!"
1422,United,@united is it even legal for you guys to advertise flights that you cant honor??
1423,United,@united customer service is the WORST. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold.
1424,United,@united was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic
1425,United,"@united love how you don't give a shit about people who tried to be loyal, but you screw them every way till Sunday. Glad I've stayed away"
1426,United,"@united tried a different flight IAH-MNL 4/1/15-4/17/15, 6 flights are advertised for $1038 but are not bookable (due to partner error)."
1427,United,@united it will be on a different airline.
1428,United,@united and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved.
1429,United,"@united clicked ""upgrade now"" and it didn't upgrade. What gives? http://t.co/N7oSjz8a59"
1430,United,@united you advertise the flight and its still on you website and still can't be book. spent over 2 hours with united support
1431,United,@united tried to book a flight IAH-MNL departing 3/31/15 returning 4/17/15 you are advertising 9 flights for $1051 that can't be book!
1432,United,@united I just booked a flight for (2). When I view my reservation it has MI connected to First name. Is this a problem? can it be changed?
1433,United,@united quick (serious) question - any resources/ratings showing the quality of service is better than 8th place? http://t.co/deWIthPeW2
1434,United,@united How do I get through @TSA to finally board UA 1534?
1435,United,"@united yes I have and I was calling in regards to speaking to someone about it even further, but unfortunately i was just bounced around."
1436,United,@united Flight 472 from ORD couldn't let me know about this? Found out via app minutes before landing. Awful flight. http://t.co/DQJl8vZ2h2
1437,United,@united i need help but in spanish
1438,United,"@united A very disappointing experience - plane mech. delay and next one didn't wait. No sincere apology, just told me to complain online"
1439,United,@united I lost my sunglasses on the flight from OKC to IAH this morning (8am takeoff) .. is there any way to retrieve them?
1440,United,@united @reccewife with the exception of everything you've asked for. Heh
1441,United,@united UA1731 - Denver to Austin...  Still on the ground...
1442,United,@united either your staff or whoever you contract with at PVD is failing you big time tonight...
1443,United,@united UA1469. Just landed.
1444,United,@united considering it. Currently gold on @delta. Why should I make the jump for an upcoming flight from SFO to Singapore?
1445,United,@united flight 435
1446,United,"@united worst flights I've ever had. ground crew ignored our plane, made me miss flight and now I have to cover the cost of a hotel. #DEN"
1447,United,@united customers aren't dumb. These revenue based programs will hurt everyone. Not gonna save money like you think
1448,United,@united it was me who had the problem won flight ua 1580. I called and rebooked myself found my own hotel and taxi
1449,United,@united will do. Thanks for the help. Cheers
1450,United,"@united bull crap.  I spent $600 on a recent trip.  That's not small change. I got 10,000 AA miles.  Would have only been 6600 UA"
1451,United,@united yes I did. Terrible service from your courrier
1452,United,@united compensate us for new clothes bet you won't
1453,United,@united I have 8 flights with you in the next two weeks :) let's make some good memories!
1454,United,"@united, we're stuck at OGG, looks like flight will be Cancelled Flightled. Can you help? =)"
1455,United,@united yea they been booked on 10 next avalible flights since sat 7am. And when time comes no plane 2nd day of work missed #hotelliving
1456,United,@united currently crying... I wanted to ski tomorrow but prolly not. Just a boy tryna fulfill his dreams
1457,United,"@united I tried the online tracking and they said something like ""attempting to locate luggage"""
1458,United,@united your worker told us not to call because we'd be talking to someone in Thailand...
1459,United,@united - Going on 3 days (tomorrow) and I still haven't received my bag from my flight to Toronto. Would love to see some seriousness here.
1460,United,@united is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do
1461,United,@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united
1462,United,@united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?
1463,United,@united you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections
1464,United,"@united if you don't like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much?"
1465,United,@united the delay is due to customer service for 20 people?  What about the DIS-SERVICE you provided for 100+?  #FlightFail #Hour20Delay
1466,United,@united he is so excellent and so reliable :) #happycustomer
1467,United,@united but again UNITED DOESNT GIVE 2 SHITS ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS
1468,United,@united its funny how none of ur tweets back are helpful what I want is to read 'ya we'll change that so our customers get better service'
1469,United,@united She is travelling from Melbourne (Australia ) to Bogota (Colombia) tomorrow
1470,United,@united Hi.  My relative's Flight Booking Problems number is MY8YB4.  Her name is Clarita Jaramillo Mejia.  Thank you
1471,United,@united it was delivered! Thank you for making sure it arrived at my doorstep!
1472,United,"@united really needs to get its act together. Really disappointed in our change of flight, delayed flights, etc."
1473,United,"@united-rebooked to OMA - 180 miles from my destination. Spotty customer service. I get staff stressors but come on, this is your business."
1474,United,@united Why have airlines always told us they can't open a cabin door once it has been closed?  This plane has done it 3 times tonight.
1475,United,‚Äú@united: Looking for a reason to travel? #quote http://t.co/GGuIg3t28z‚Äù
1476,United,@united I can't find any Late Flight evening flights. Are there other airports that would have an overnight flight?
1477,United,@united Thanks for the vague canned response that doesn't address the issue!
1478,United,@united thank you!
1479,United,@united that's not good enough for all of us affected by the awful organization and timing and have now been set back
1480,United,@united  Otis in the baggage claim by Bay #8. not at all happy but not nearly as pissed.
1481,United,@united Why is my time less important to you?  #StrandUsInDenver #HourAndTenMinuteDelay #FlightFail
1482,United,@united airlines: you kidding? Bagage lost this morning from ny to Washington and still no trace? #badservice
1483,United,@united I did. It took about an hour and a half though
1484,United,@united Why have you never held a plane for me? #HourDelay #MultipleDoorOpeningAndClosing #DangerOfGettingSnowedIn
1485,United,@united i did but i got nothing from it. Just dissapointment =(
1486,United,@united WHERE IS MY FUCKING BAG?!?! Where the fuck is my fucking bag??? TELL ME NOW OR GIVE ME A NUMBER TO CALL A HUMAN. SAN68059M
1487,United,@united I was sincerely thanking the pilot of flight 4461 of braving the snow and getting me home amongst many other Cancelled Flightlations.
1488,United,@united Made@it to the gate at 8:23 and they wouldn't let us on. http://t.co/xAToxBnsFa
1489,United,@united time to give up my 1K status and switch to @Delta - you are so terrible I can't even describe.
1490,United,"@united Thanks! LOL! #UA6259 will wait for us. Per @flightaware, same tail number as #UA5525 :)"
1491,United,@united You suck. Flight delayed equipment probs again. Miss connection by 2 minutes and you won't let us on even though it's at the gate.
1492,United,@United #1758 now going in 40 min waiting for other plane to vacate gate. #findanothergate
1493,United,@united Flight 2 is 2:30 hrs delayed so far b/c of Late Flight crew. Now we are literally waiting while they have dinner acc. to honest gate agent.
1494,United,@United many people on Ua6318 are going to miss connections due to long wait time in SFO tarmac. Seriously u can't find an empty gate?
1495,United,@united You're trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant.
1496,United,@united we've been waiting 45 min for a gate at SFO... Yet so many of them are free.  Your excellence in operational efficiency is showing
1497,United,"@United ""delayed due to customer service"" Huh? http://t.co/XlTV5z6sT1"
1498,United,@united what about the poor customer service at checkin at Kansas KCI?!? That's it???
1499,United,@united except all of that delayed the flight anyway.
1500,United,@United maybe find a different gate #ua1758
1501,United,@united I sent a message. It's very irresponsible that my suitcase cannot be found. This is truly worst service ever... #fedup #disastrous
1502,United,@United landed in den on time stuck waiting for gate for 30 min. Maybe an update would be a good idea capt?
1503,United,@united wanted to point out that not one United crew has been sympathetic. Questions unanswered. MileagePlus is starting to look like a joke
1504,United,@united can we get an explanation on why UA978 from S√£o Paulo to Houston has been delayed? Now we're hearing from crew about Cancelled Flightlations.
1505,United,@united Why was flight 1180 EWR to MCO Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow and what do I do to rebook. Asking for a relative.
1506,United,@united Can you tell me Jet Airways award availability?
1507,United,"@united I understand the intent was not to inconvenience, but catching a cab back to the airport to show them wet clothes wasn't an option."
1508,United,@united What are the chances of my flight to EWR from PIT being Cancelled Flighted tomorrow?
1509,United,@united @baftz rcvd promo if i booked flight silver status would be extended it was not dont have flier that was sent didnt think id need
1510,United,"@united, wife landed in DC 5hrs ago. luggage did not, was told it would B delivered/Hotel by 8pm. It's now 10pm, no luggage. #UA484"
1511,United,@united on a flight at 11:30 tomorrow.
1512,United,@united not sure why the people in row 7 that paid for a premium seat can't use their overhead space... http://t.co/i9s86KiHge
1513,United,@united is so cheap they couldn't afford to run the AC on #UA1510. They took pressure cooker to a new level. #Cheap #WorstAirline
1514,United,@united why is it that Sundays when my husband travels to Chicago he's stuck at Tarmac &amp; misses connecting flight always
1515,United,@united Well I can tell you that your customer service at RDU airport is horrific but is exception at O'Hare in Chicago.
1516,United,@united sitting on UAL 683 - a comedy of errors.  UAL is incompetent
1517,United,"@united on #UA3785 tonight and told delayed due to Late Flight crew. No idea where crew coming from, your staff ++unhelpful. Any ideas?"
1518,United,"@united, take a look at status of 683, sitting at ORD ... This ain't cool, yo."
1519,United,@united bummer but thank you for the quick response
1520,United,@united I didn't have time to take my wet clothes/suit back to the airport and wasn't going to pay for another cab to do so.
1521,United,@united didn't realize my bag/ contents were wet until I got to my hotel. Sent my suit/shirts out to be dry cleaned. Mtgs start tomorrow.
1522,United,"@united You load our plane at ORD knowing pilots are 2 hrs Late Flight, then discover plane needs to be fueled? #WTF #united #incompetent"
1523,United,@united resolved and im sick and tired of waiting on you. I want my refund and I'd like to speak to someone about it.
1524,United,@united I'm really glad I just waited on the phone for over an hour to be sent to a voicemail. Your customer service sucks. Nothing has been
1525,United,"@united, you just caused a riot on the airplane. Never seen anything like this"
1526,United,"@united Instead of sending inaccurate emails about delay every 5 min, just say we will get you there when we get you there."
1527,United,@united so glad I've been waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes and Ive been transferred 3 times without resolving anything. Worst service ever.
1528,United,@united we still need help. Hung up on twice. Customer service rep said there is no way to help between the gate rep and phone rep.
1529,United,"@united They let us know in advance of the reboot, yes :) Thanks for the attentiveness!"
1530,United,@united lol too little too Late Flight
1531,United,@united yes. Bags came 1 hr after I arrived at baggage claim. Awful experience on the ground at BHM
1532,United,@united @FernHeinig18 your delay is due to your own making. We have now been back to the gate multiple times. Maybe take accountability
1533,United,@united Why do I have to give up my leg room so these 4 people (not in my row) can fill the bin?  Pls start charging. http://t.co/2nY5TuXFqf
1534,United,@united please tell CLT flight 4232 needs a gate. Waiting now for 15 mins.
1535,United,@united Why did you load us in this flying sardine can if you knew the pilots were 2 hours Late Flight?? #incompetent beyond belief
1536,United,@united booked EWR-FLL in first for two on 3-8. Let's see how you compare to the garbage @AmericanAir first class has become
1537,United,@united your seats are god awful.
1538,United,@united good try but @SouthwestAir got her here safer and sooner
1539,United,@United Wanted to compliment ur phone agent Jeanette for reFlight Booking Problems RDU to SEA thru SFO after connecting flight thru EWR was Cancelled Flightled.
1540,United,@united 3 hour 45 min delay so far..... Would love to round to 4 hours to just go to bed!
1541,United,@united Educate Bohol is a 501(c)(3) w/all volunteer staff. I can help the kids or buy a plane ticket ...I can't do both. Can you help?
1542,United,"@united I need to get from Albuquerque, NM, USA, to Cebu, Philippines. I'm providing educational help for 800 kids. Can you help me?"
1543,United,@united I'm on UA1118 and my direct tv isn't working.  How do I avoid this in future?
1544,United,@United is truly the drunk uncle of boarding. Don't believe gate agent that overhead is full; don't reserve aisle http://t.co/cdZhTyd0aK
1545,United,@united i sure will
1546,United,@united on the plane. I was thoughtful enough to ask for it and got it; there are prob others that also deserved it
1547,United,"@united, any options to cos tonight? Doesn't look like #UA5525 will make it in time for #UA6259. Should I reserve a hotel room?"
1548,United,"@united Appreciated, but in this case we waited an extra 55 minutes for a lost mechanic to fax the log. Fax...like in the 80s."
1549,United,@united S/O to @Delta for coming in clutch and finally taking me home üôåüôå
1550,United,@united customer service sucks!  They hang up after waiting an hour and talking for 5 minutes.
1551,United,@united JP - DM message who? Can't get a DM through to @united
1552,United,@united strikes again! Why board anyone if there's something wrong with the plane? Common sense.
1553,United,@united:  thanks for the miserable trip GNV&lt;&lt;&lt;FSD on 2.19-2.21.
1554,United,@united Missed KTM flight due to ur Cancelled Flightlation. Mike supervisor disgusting.  Now day Late Flight. No apology or upgrade offer to LHR from ORD???
1555,United,@united left my iPad on MCO-&gt;IAD flight 174. How long to hear back once claim submitted? TY!
1556,United,@united social media team is on point on #OscarNight :)
1557,United,@united always happy to start my life with my new wife with a 5 hr travel delay due to MAINTENECE and it would appear incompetence
1558,United,@united is the airline of the Oscars but doesn't carry ABC on Direct TV?!?! Fail - now I can't watch the Oscars. #united
1559,United,@united this is it... Last time I fly #UnitedAirlines  you screw up every trip now will be stuck in ord and miss work.
1560,United,@united Didn't know that buying a seat in first class was just a 'request' to sit in first class! Very Interesting.
1561,United,"@united I understand the intention, but it pales in comparison to a day of lost wages for both my wife and I because of the delay."
1562,United,@united I need help with a missing bag.
1563,United,@united I was. But I have given up.
1564,United,"@united can I get on a stand by list from ASE to ORD? I'm the only poor person in Aspen, that's why I'm asking for standby on twitter."
1565,United,@united you changed my entire flight plan for vacation and now I will be there alone a day and night early with nowhere to stay. Help!
1566,United,@united UA647 heading back to gate bc improper load? if ur packing us to the gills should at least take care to load bags. expecting comp...
1567,United,@united is the worst airlines sitting on the plane at  Houston-bush airport now for an hour and a half waiting for Late Flight passengers
1568,United,@united might possibly have the worst service on the planet.
1569,United,@united deceptive marketing practices promised me if i booked flights i would retain my status now they are not granting. Neverflyunited
1570,United,@united Hey so many time changes for UA 1534. We going tonight or what? MIA - EWR
1571,United,@united and that it would be sent on the next flight to Hayden/steamboat (HDN) from Denver. So I'm hoping its on there
1572,United,@united and pick it up and just bring it on the shuttle. When I went to double check on that they said it was still on the concourse
1573,United,@united I honestly couldn't tell you. All I know is that originally we were going to have it brought in from the concourse
1574,United,@united missing a day of vacation to see my husband because of this delay but stuff happens and I get that. Just wish it was handled better
1575,United,@united UA1534 has now had 11 different departure times. Wtf. Make up your mind.
1576,United,@united thanks for making everyone wait in the dark for an hour while Newark tries to figure out which gate to go to. #incompetence
1577,United,@united thank you for following up!
1578,United,@United Claudia in IAH terminal b travel assistance has me all set. Great service. Thank you.
1579,United,@united is it possible to add a Known Traveler Number to my ticket after Flight Booking Problems?
1580,United,"@united why doesn't my daughter, booked with my gold member miles, get on the upgrade list for her flight tomorrow?"
1581,United,@united If an award is no longer showing available could it possible become available again?
1582,United,@united flight to DFW from IAD Cancelled Flightled for mechanical can I get rental car to MDT-my origin
1583,United,@United can you help me get from IAH to SFO earlier tonight?
1584,United,@united was so on point for 5/6 of my flights this past week . . But this last one really sucks shit
1585,United,@United and here i thought American was bad. Horrible Service. Over 2:30 min Late Flight. No excuse!
1586,United,@united UA1565 IAH -&gt; SJO is delayed by like 1.5 hours. Crazy!
1587,United,@united I don't know my flight details bc I need to explore some options which I'm unable to do bc the site won't let me.Seems to be ongoing
1588,United,@united How about free wifi when your flights delayed? Only 20 mins allowed!
1589,United,@united I did. they told us the wrong carousel number.
1590,United,@united no thanks
1591,United,@united CDG-LAS 42 hours. And my luggage is in SFO. I've been wearing the same clothes for 42 hours. Thank you. #flythefriendlyskies
1592,United,@united this airline is a joke my friends been trapped in houston since 7am sat and have no flight in sight #unitedworstever #trappedhouston
1593,United,@united why do you hate your passengers?
1594,United,@united how can a plane that has been sitting in a hanger all day have numerous mechanical problems. Doesn't anyone actually do maintenance
1595,United,.@united in the future when delay causes 15 hour wait (slept night in airport) ensuring seating choice for replacement flight would be good.
1596,United,@united is my flight delayed? It keeps changing between delayed and not??? If delayed is checkin time Late Flightr??? http://t.co/NTUIx5dbYR
1597,United,@united what a long day of delays. Please get us to Dallas tonight!!!!  Fingers crossed!!!  #winterstorm2015 #whichisworsedenordfw.
1598,United,@united -How is it that all my flight times were changed without any official notification? Almost missed my flight this morning. Not cool!
1599,United,@united they had record of it being at Denver on the concourse prior to me gettin on the shuttle. I just want to confirm its location
1600,United,@united #LAX #sunrise UAL212 LAX-JFK
1601,United,@united ...would be on the next flight to Hayden/steamboat
1602,United,@united we needed to be at steamboat for a meeting by 3pm so we took a shuttle. The United customer service people said the bag would be on
1603,United,"@united, there is no good word for describing how angry and pissed off of a customer you have made me."
1604,United,"@united Late Flight 2014 and 2015 are huge step towards decline in service, and your agents, not all, are as arrogant as ever.  #UnitedAirlines"

1607,United,@united false.

1609,United,"@united thanks, it was my first time in a United lounge and felt welcomed."

1630,United,@united EVERYTIME I fly UR airline I hate you even more ! Thanks for the terrible service on flight 1071
1631,United,".@united Really? Was bumped down from Gold status, asked to pay $$ to keep it, and get fewer miles... How is that worth it?"
1632,United,@united you always surprise me with the awfulness of your airline. You guys suck. #worst

1651,United,". @united 5 hours, 3 gates, and 3 planes Late Flightr still not an update, explanation, or apology to be had. #WorstAirlineEver #UnitedAirlines"
1652,United,"@united your gate attendant had some snobby remarks, your customer service is like playing poker with my sisters kids!"
1653,United,"@united Poor cabin luggage service on UA1266 to BOS, I was forced to check in even when there was empty space for bags in the overhead!"
1654,United,"@united when I click that link it wants my flight info. I haven't booked a flight yet. I read you waive fees for military, it this true?"
1655,United,"@united no, we still have not heard anything from anyone at @united or the @ErieAirport"

1663,United,@united it was such a lovely part of this long day - attendants on UA5168 (most) /UA795 were beyond exceptional today. #GiveThoseLadiesRaise
1664,United,@united 4 open seats in 1st class on UA 2065. Way to honor your upgrade policy for freq flyers and/or honor an employee with an upgrade.
1665,United,@united I trust you enough to put my coat in my checked bag!
1666,United,@united yes I have &amp; they're unsure when it would come.This has never happened on any airline and my first time with @united #disappointed
1667,United,@united of course. But interesting how United doesn't seem to have a good sense on what's happening with flight
1668,United,@united pushing five hours and my time is worth nothing to you. reFlight Booking Problems not an option unfortunately.
1669,United,"@united finally made it to rep, who solved my problem."
1670,United,@united you guys are complete ass
1671,United,@united thanks gate agent extraordinaire Seau Fong for helping me get re-booked out of Boise and (hopefully) home to NYC sometime tonight!
1672,United,@united why are your agents working so slowly to rebook people who are on #UA1481. We have all wasted an entire day at STT.
1673,United,@united Thank y'all for being an amazing airline who knows how to treat their customers. you guys rock!
1674,United,@united you friend's flt from ase to Denver is Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow.  Can you help with rebook?
1675,United,@united - Plane came in with broken seat.  Rather than fix it they put a broken sign on it and separated me from my kids.
1676,United,@united worst flying experience ever and they tried to blame it on ATC?! I watched them load bags for 30min after boarding 45min Late Flight
1677,United,@united used to (still do?) let you listen to flight radio...I often did...interesting to me #TCMParty #CE3K #31DaysOfOscar
1678,United,@united went to Customer Service kiosk and they were able to help out! Still thanks for following up!
1679,United,@united have you read your own same day travel change policy?
1680,United,"@united your b737-800w  literally the smallest seats I have ever have, my dad got stuck In the tiny bathroom ad well #disspointed #premier1k"
1681,United,@united AND WE GOT ZERO VOUCHERS FOR HOTEL OR CAB. I expect some SERIOUS mileage credits.
1682,United,@united nope all set. Thx for checking.
1683,United,@united +the plane.
1684,United,"@united my flight was already Cancelled Flightled this morning because of a ""snow storm in Denver"". And now I'm in DC waiting for a pilot to get on+"
1685,United,@united still sucks. I don't understand why you have two cust service agents for a long line at Houston international b gate #unitedsucks
1686,United,"@united the most frustrating flying experience. One continuous ""I dunno what time you will leave today. "". Dunno?! That's code for ...?"
1687,United,"@united on 2/20 Denver AP, gate B91 (destination Santa Fe), agent Ashley did an amazing job in the face of an angry traveler. Kudos."
1688,United,@united has an United flight ever been on time. #americanisbetter
1689,United,@united I'd rather spend two days in the back seat of a Volkswagen than two hours on your plane! #disgruntled #whatacluster
1690,United,@united my flight was supposed to depart to Boston at 4:36 and now it's departing at 6:30 due to issues with finding a pilot. Thanks a lot!!
1691,United,@united I suppose your customers enjoy screaming toddlers then. Not my problem if someone complains!
1692,United,"@united you could give me free flights for life, and I'd still choose to purchase my tickets from a competitor."
1693,United,@united The first time I flew United was horrible thought I would give you a second chance. There will NOT be a third! #disgruntled
1694,United,@united flight from san fransico to jfk was evacuated why?
1695,United,"@united 4994 out of Jackson, Wyoming... Delayed by no pilots.. Full toilets.. Deplaned 2ndary to mechanical fail.. Cancelled Flightled flight pending"
1696,United,@united is by far THE WORST airline I've ever had the misfortune of flying with in all the 44 countries I've flown to!!! It's outrageous!
1697,United,"@united ... I want my bag off flight 1142, what do I do now?"
1698,United,@united thanks for causing us to miss our connection and now a 6hour delay #flydeltanexttime
1699,United,@united I do not see where it talks about military baggage fees. Can you please guide me. Thanks
1700,United,@united I hope you lose the next govt contract
1701,United,@united lost my bags and there was a flight from Chi to Eri that landed over 1.5 hrs ago...yet still have zero updates?? #UnitedAirlinesSux
1702,United,@united i will just send my confirmation number when I get home safe and sound. This is why i pay so expensive services to you!
1703,United,@united the bag is in a state that I didn't travel to and the airports don't fly to each other. Looks like it'll never show
1704,United,@united ridiculous! I have to be refunded whenever I get at my final destination or not!
1705,United,@united stay more than 24h traveling ans sleeping on the airports floor
1706,United,@united seriously?   UA 806.  Delayed because of the copilot isn't here?  For 1.5 hours and he is only flying from Raleigh? Disappointing
1707,United,@united seriously. This is just complete bs.
1708,United,"@united, we've been waiting for over an hour for our luggage- what gives?"
1709,United,@united the costumer services here at Denver Intl Airport is ridiculous bad!
1710,United,@united Lied to my face at the gate about upgrades. Thanks. #badservice #unitedsucks
1711,United,@united I have proof that my situation now is due to company mistake
1712,United,@united ouch not fair
1713,United,@united is synonymous to with #rude. And #cheap. You really don't know how to value the customer
1714,United,@united I have to go back home! I have to use what the company has available. But it's unfair to stay more than 24 h traveling
1715,United,@united if I miss the #Oscars I'll never fly united again
1716,United,@united is the stingiest airline. Nobody should model after them. #PTFO #cheap #bastards #stingy
1717,United,"@united flight delayed...again...every time. ""Maintenance issues"""
1718,United,@united I should be fine. They automatically changed my connecting flight for me so I wouldn't miss it. A+ work.
1719,United,@united yes... A ride home would be perfect.. A fete one would assume possible after charging 1600$ for a domestic flight... Ps we deplaned
1720,United,@united I'll be calling tomorrow
1721,United,@united and I was denied an upgrade because of catering issues??? #poorservice
1722,United,@united--excited to barrel through the sky at 600mph on a 75 ton piece of metal operated by a company that can't get their tiny TVs to work!
1723,United,"@united heard about the voucher/miles credit for Cancelled Flighting my international flight yesterday, but I didn't get an email."
1724,United,"@united, maybe don't play the video about how your flights are outfitted w wifi on the flights where wifi isn't working...‚úàÔ∏è"
1725,United,@united on line baggage system complete rubbish. bag missing 2 days. No meaningful information.
1726,United,@united...do you still have flat tire policy.  Shuttle broke down on way to ORD.  Will probably miss the 425pm to CLE...Help please!!
1727,United,@united thanks. Just was able to do it on the app myself. Still not customer service to be seen in YYZ
1728,United,"@united thx off the response, finally got through the 45 min wait and talked to someone."
1729,United,@united so unhelpful... http://t.co/vBfIeo2qJC
1730,United,@united I would take the $500 voucher you offered for MISCOUNTING THE # OF SEATS ON YOUR PLANE but that means I would have to fly you again
1731,United,@united - 3 of 6 First seats open on UA5097. No upgrades processed. Gate agents @yyz said their too busy. Not cool http://t.co/6KpyhckA9l
1732,United,@united @rayja9 flying to las vegas out of Chicago flight is Late Flight and no announcement has been made
1733,United,@united I believe. It was Cancelled Flighted yesterday I guess. Goes back to no notification from United about Cancelled Flightlation
1734,United,"@United - In case you're reading this, UA230, right now, 7D. So many oversized carryons taking up too much room. Enforce your rules."
1735,United,"@United is an airline where you pay extra to get a better seat but by the time you board your overbooked flight, there's no overhead space."
1736,United,"@united Okay, just requested to follow."
1737,United,"@united Thx, just DM'd. Conf #'s MQXC64 &amp; MPWNC2. Any help appreciated"
1738,United,@united make sure you take care of @LSUsoftball team &amp; @LSUQuinlanDuhon team. We are 16-0!!!!
1739,United,"@united Delayed 7 hrs flight 5721 PIT/IAD, finally board the plane, sit half hour &amp; crew is at their hrs limit &amp; we deplane. Unacceptable."
1740,United,@united stuck in YYZ because staff took a break? Not happy 1K....
1741,United,@United Personal Device Entertainment system is great but with app crashing every 10/15 mins I'm glad it's free for now.
1742,United,@united pls stop sending texts every 15mins saying my flight is delayed another 15mins-It's been 3hrs. I usually defend u but this is lame..
1743,United,"@united agent, ""You should use the bathroom before boarding.. Toilets onboard are full."" Oh you can expected a strongly worded email FUnited"
1744,United,"@united should hire extra customer service reps. 50 minute wait time to ask one question? I would rather just fly another airline, thanks."
1745,United,@united united flight UA3774 after two delays just Cancelled Flightled no explanation &amp; no more flights to Norfolk that aren't booked. Renting a car.
1746,United,@united I'll try it. Mileage programs have historically been a lifeline for us world-hungry travelers of moderate means.
1747,United,"@united any way you can help me find a flight to LAS? Stuck in DIA, sat on plane 2 hrs, now been waiting an hour for an update."
1748,United,@United 50 minute wait times to help with a Cancelled Flightled flight?? Help a guy out?
1749,United,@united I was rebooked but had to take bus from Portland Maine to Boston. Told United does not cover the charge.
1750,United,@united there is a sector whereby it says $0 in both bags...no bag allowance at all in international flight?
1751,United,@United You were doing so well until the PHL-SFO flight yesterday. Major miss. Unfriendly Premier cabin crew. Baggage cluster at SFO.
1752,United,"@united Your baggage tracking system is worthless! It tells me nothing about where the bag is, much less what your plans are to get it to me"
1753,United,@United is offering to reroute my SFO flight to LAX. Might be geography class time.
1754,United,@united thank you for letting me down.My luggage is still in Denver but I'm in Phl. #neveragain #flyingwithUS #disappointed #lostacustomer
1755,United,@united can you get me on the delayed flight to EWR out of YYZ at 15:30? No customer service to be found in airport
1756,United,@united flight UA3774 after two delays. just Cancelled Flightled and no more flights to Norfolk that aren't booked. Renting a car.
1757,United,"@united thanks for having no one to pilot my last two flights, and all but stranding me in Houston tonight.  Airlines are the absolute worst"
1758,United,@united so disgusted and disappointed with united airlines luggage policies and attitude toward musicians. Unacceptable
1759,United,"@united missing my amazing us bank work conference, not ok.  What do I do now?????"
1760,United,"@united ... frozen lines on flight, not continuing due to 'passenger comfort'? Not ok, sat on the plane as long as a flight to Vegas would !"
1761,United,@united my last call your customer service agent called me back... As he was stuck on hold to air Canada.. Just hope he's booked me a flight
1762,United,@united you left my bag in Houston last night. It's freezing cold in Memphis. Any idea on when I will see it? Off again tomorrow.
1763,United,@united this is why I fly @SouthwestAir ... Never have any issues
1764,United,@united has terrible customer service &amp; doesn't feel the need to notify its customers when their flights are delayed
1765,United,"@united I have tried and you have failed. Still no wifi ever, last row in the middle and I fly every week. Thanks for nothing."
1766,United,@united great flight into PVD. Smallest plane I have ever been on and smoothest landing ever!
1767,United,@united trying to check in for tomorrow's flight. website keeps timing out. what's up?
1768,United,"@united yes, computer would allow me to get to San Diego quick but customer service will not help.  Says can't rebook http://t.co/KcVUbUYExc"
1769,United,"@United says we had a weather delay in #YXE this morning. The ""weather"" didn't affect any other airline. #UA6136 http://t.co/4JdvK8tCqx"
1770,United,@united Do you have Bereavement discount on airfare as my grandfather just passed and need to attend his funeral this week.
1771,United,"@united It was Cancelled Flightled, none of the passengers were notified. Complete violation of travelers' rights.  @AerocivilCol"

1776,United,@united You must follow me in order for me to send you a direct message if that is what you meant.
1777,United,@united I don't know what DM the confirmation number means.
1778,United,"@united Waiting for 3494 EWR-ORD, delayed 47 mins. Might miss 5491 ORD-YWG at 6pm CT. Any room on 5644 ORD-YWG in case I miss connex?"

1780,United,"@united - well, now finally on board hopefully we take off this time and quickly. Well over an hour delay!!"
1781,United,@united I missed my connection already. Then I missed the next flight they put me on.  Now I'm going to LAX instead of Hawaii.  :(
1782,United,@united reservation was made last July. I want to know why I wasn't reseated. This only happens on international itineraries
1783,United,@united line full of worried customers and guy at desk says so sorry you will have to take care of your problems Late Flightr I don't have time.
1784,United,"@united 

There must be 100 people waiting in line for customer service at DEN to deal with flight Cancelled Flightations."
1785,United,"@united, American never had my bags apparently. United never switched them over. Had to go back to United Baggage Service."
1786,United,@united unacceptable. 403 was 90 min Late Flight for a 'missing screw' our flight to Tucson left before we even landed
1787,United,"@united CMH gate staff a disaster..#3345 overbooked, no volunteers, no boarding, 20 min Late Flight trying to figure out issue #bringbackrealstaff"
1788,United,"@united Waiting half an hour for my checked bag at EWR (&amp; that was Priority); disappointing, usually you guys are good."
1789,United,@united Are your earnings so low that checkin people have to also be on Tarmac loading bags? JAN
1790,United,"@united thank you for dishonoring my upgrade and putting me in a seat I didn't want, all while not even notifying me.  Great 1K service üëé"
1791,United,@united you guys are gay
1792,United,@united the emails/calls over the past months about flight changes were helpful wish you would have sent them on the Cancelled Flightlation yesterday
1793,United,"@united - so they changed depart from 1:45 to 2:00pm &amp; it is now 1:40pm &amp; the Capt. just got off the plane to find a smoothie, 2pm my ass!!!"
1794,United,"@united Thanks so much , my passport was recovered"
1795,United,@united  Thanks for nothing! No Atlanta Lounge? Your Ap says NO. Sure nothing at Terminal T http://t.co/tFjfMSHa2k
1796,United,@united no thank you
1797,United,"@united - tick, tock, tick, tock, it is rapidly approaching the next dream departure of 1:45pm. When is the next fantasy departure time??"
1798,United,@united it would make my day if I could take a flight on your airline without any hiccups on your end. Train your employees to communicate
1799,United,"@united a baby shit its pants half way through my flight and it smelled like shit, what are you going to do about this?"
1800,United,"@united You cause me to miss my flight telling me it already left when it had not. No empathy from gate staff or crew, no apology. Really?"
1801,United,@United rescheduled my return flight from #Japan?  Uh why?  Trying to call #UnitedAirlines #customerservice - 45 min wait.  #fun
1802,United,@united is by far the worst airline ever üò°üò°
1803,United,"@united, no. Re-booked with American and United said they'd transfer our bags to them."
1804,United,@united I am appalled at your lack of communication during our awful journey on 2/21 EWR to BOS. 4 hr delays need to be explained better.
1805,United,@united I'm DMing my info and no is assisting. My flight home left before m first flight had even landed
1806,United,@united Boston is all self service. Swipe yr own boarding pass at gate. Most difficult: Tag your own bag. Not easy! #ImproveTheProcess
1807,United,@united Name correct on original confirmation but spelled wrong on check-in reminder. First name and MI run together. Cause for concern?
1808,United,@united more people would catch their flights if your attendants had more help!
1809,United,"@United no consistency, #Denver agents say no standby with checked baggage citing FAA. Your website policy says otherwise. #time2switch"
1810,United,Only 14 biz days (18 calendar) to respond to my inquiry @united ?  I hope your standards are universally adopted :-/ #BadCustomerService
1811,United,@united Thanks but why did this occur? You guys had 3 hours extra to get my bag on due to your delay. So that's 7 hours you had. #fail!
1812,United,@united so many delays today...What's up with that? Hoping my 12:26pm flight boards soon. #United #premier1K
1813,United,"@united your website is fucked up. Now instead of a $416 flight I should‚Äôve had yesterday, it‚Äôs $514 today. Thanks."
1814,United,@united called back and I've been on hold. What is the issue?! I have a confirmation number and an email that shows how much I've paid
1815,United,"@united I'm not sure how you can help. Your flight experience is terrible, planes are dirty and staff is rude. Start over perhaps?"
1816,United,@united check in and it's still saying I haven't paid. I've called back twice was on hold for 30 minutes then they answered and hung up. I
1817,United,@united hold for 30 minutes finally got someone and they retook my form of payment and confirmed that my reservation was set. I tried to
1818,United,"@united welcome to our world, that's a snow world today. @GooseBayAirport Goose Bay, Labrador, Canada. http://t.co/4kI6Xr67nk"
1819,United,@united I bought a ticket yesterday and received a confirmation. Tried to check in and they said I hadn't paid for it. So I called was on

1838,United,@united Adding reservation to iOS app doesn't show up on desktop site when logged in. And miles can't be redeemed for upgrades thru your app
1839,United,@united I assume that would be for the other 300 people who have been let down by United? What's worse is plane is here but crew can't fly!!

1848,United,@united no. I need you to have more than 2 agents at check in.
1849,United,@united so this did not work out at all!! Incredibly unfriendly ground staff and false promises over Twitter @theairhelper
1850,United,"@united we got it, thanks."
1851,United,@united The so below skilled staff and inadequate system just deleted my return from Houston to Norway. Shoulder shrugging is all you do..

1867,United,@united pls follow for DM
1868,United,"@united ah, that would explain why crew didn't seem particularly distressed when we pointed it out. It was a little startling at first."

1879,United,@united who authors this fiction? I just heard on radio we don't even have a jetway secured yet #UA5037 #CMH http://t.co/T78k7aBtWF
1880,United,@united so? Found anything or just showing off? You do realise that the morning flight that you Cancelled Flightled was more pricey than the evening?
1881,United,@united oh I did. Was still lost. Your tracking system stinks as does the delivery system.
1882,United,@united feeling like a true united customer stuck.on the tarmac in dc for over 2 hrs. UNITEDFAIL
1883,United,@united pls follow for DM.
1884,United,@united leadership counts. landed at 11:15 last night-deplaned at 12:40. 45 minutes of that was waiting for the jetway. Inexcusable
1885,United,@united I sent you a DM as requested but have not heard anything. Can you address the issue I brought up in my DM and explain what happened?
1886,United,@united employee=faceless. Don't throw them under the bus. Starts with management. I'm almost a million miler and own my own company. 1/2
1887,United,@united you can't say the flight is pulled in and departs in 2 mins if boarding hasn't even started! http://t.co/2IKbP8gxWi
1888,United,@united  I understand that but why should I pay to change if it was a problem with your plane. If it was weather I would understand
1889,United,@united 30 hours Late Flightr still no answers stuck in Houston. Keep getting put on phantom flights that never apeared. #BadCustomerService
1890,United,@united you guys are horrible! First we get stuck in the snow for a hr in ewr now sitting in cmh saying it could be 30min for a gate
1891,United,"@united the hotel you sent us to wouldnt take the voucher. Our flight was delayed, then Cancelled Flightled, then delayed again. 32 hours and counting"
1892,United,@united DM'd you 4 hrs ago at your request. No response to be found .... just like my bag.
1893,United,@united worked out after all. Thanks for your immediate reply!!

1896,United,"@united as if a 4 hour maintenance delay wasn't enuf, u charge me $25/bag as a global service platinum mbr. Get ur shit together"
1897,United,@united last week we also had maintenance issues and a flat tire. Another flight last week was Cancelled Flighted. Your track record is the WORST!
1898,United,@united this customer service experience will be tweeted for quality assurance.
1899,United,@united you should spend all of the money you take for our tickets and update your planes! Each flight has a maintenance issue!!!
1900,United,@united can you put Russell Daiber (on same ticket) as well into premium Eco? Appreciated!
1901,United,@united can you get me to okc from Sacramento today. Dfw is now closed
1902,United,@united any chance you could help rebook?? My flight Cancelled Flightled
1903,United,"@united Out of curiosity, when a flight is arranged, are pilots notified? There are a lot of ""pilots haven't arrived yet"" announcements."
1904,United,@united Yes. To Boston. I was going to Providence.
1905,United,@united you really need a better system for handling Cancelled Flightled flights http://t.co/3uBCoAsyws
1906,United,@united how are conditions in BOS today? I'm in UA994. Everything appears to be in time but I wanted to check.
1907,United,@united same day flights
1908,United,@united It is also inappropriate to lie to passengers to induce them into accepting a voucher by telling them you have availability on Late Flightr
1909,United,@United give me a direct number I can call regarding my lost baggage immediately.
1910,United,@united involuntarily bumped your passenger and can't guarantee them another flight for three days!
1911,United,@united Please follow FAA guidelines regarding bumping. It is NOT acceptable to give a $300 voucher for an $800 fare when you've

1913,United,".@united Our newest delay, right now http://t.co/96fTLZWtvO"
1914,United,"@united. If you show available seats, you need to honor that! I shouldnt spend 1hr on phone to hear that ""really there are 3 not 4 seats"""
1915,United,@united 50 min on hold trying to book award flight because site errors out.  Agents ask for my pin to see platinum availability??? badbadbad
1916,United,@united is a joke.  Lots of angry people at IAH this AM.

1921,United,"@united Nicole at Quito airport took great care of us this week. Handled lost baggage, seat changes. Very professional/nice. Pat her back."
1922,United,@united why de-ice before taxing? Maybe it #makestoomuchsense ? #shouldhaveflowndelta #unitedsucks @Delta @SouthwestAir @AmericanAir
1923,United,@united Flight 1547 CMH to ORD just arrived at gate. Next segment to YVR already boarding. Will they hold it?
1924,United,"@united right as we think we will take off, we stop to get de-iced. Why wasn't this done when the planes were sitting out all night?"
1925,United,@united two service agents hung up on me the third was able to get me a flight on US air today. Three calls and 2.5 hours to get a flight
1926,United,@united Delayed more and more these days. MCO &gt; IAD. Fingers crossed I make my connection home to Albany. #united1K
1927,United,"@united your first class is a joke, compared to all the others I have flown, don't ask for extra peanuts... That's NOT allowed! @AirCanada"
1928,United,@united I have been given a connection with 2 overnight layovers. No vouchers. Last connection not even confirmed.

1932,United,@united thank you for fully boarding flight 1689 this morning before noticing we had no pilots. #fail
1933,United,@united the long wait was the icing on the cake. Why don't you fix your reservation system so the confirm # doesn't get changed mid-travel

1942,United,"@united : flight delayed by 24 hours, lost my wallet, have no money to eat or sleep yet your representatives will not help.#unitedsucks"
1943,United,@united lost 4 loyal customers and mileage plus card holders. We could have driven to Florida from Pa quicker both ways! Worst trip ever!
1944,United,@united they let us board again but will we fly this time? Who knows! #shouldhaveflowndelta
1945,United,@united apparently sleeping in B terminal wasn't the worst situation. Someone told other UA passengers they had to sleep at baggage claim.
1946,United,@united why don't you de-ice while the plane sits there with no one in it for 2 hours ?? Or we could just delay :/
1947,United,@united fuck you for not caring üò¢
1948,United,"@united its been five days, I'm just asking you to clarify your policy on car seats. I don't want to have to take this higher up."

1956,United,@united If United loses your baggage they will get it to the airport in the country your in and then it disappears!

1961,United,@united why would you overnight my bag Wed to an unknown location with a courier company you apparently can't contact!
1962,United,"@united Hey, thanks again for helping me miss my buddies 30th bday, you guys are really a trashy company #shouldhaveflowndelta #unitedsucks"
1963,United,@united I have never been more frustrated than my conversations with United who can't speak Spanish to the courier company that has my bag!

2056,United,@united averaging 200 minute wait times tonight or what? I've gotten no help from you tonight.
2057,United,@united thanks for nothing. Really?!? 60 minute wait times when I've had to call back 4x. That's 240minute wait times.
2058,United,@united you're customer service is unbelievably bad. Abysmal. I've been on the phone for well over 2hrs tonight. Hung up on by yr ppl 3x.
2059,United,@united you can read the full story when I submit a case to your team about the pilot of flight 6232 and why we are sleeping in DIA
2060,United,@united what's with the layover in Canada from the UA125? Is that scheduled?
2061,United,@united an inconvenience is a weather delay. Your pilot deciding to waste enough time so the FAA wouldn't let him fly is negligence.
2062,United,@united I bought a ticket with a price that was published by mistake and now I got an email that indicates United Cancelled Flightled my ticket! Why?
2063,United,@united new 737 plane; wifi: not working. Entertainment: non existent. New Seats: seriously uncomfortable. Really? #unitedfail UA1550
2064,United,@united - you sure missed the mark on tonight's redeye from LAX to Chicago. What a mess! You can do better!
2065,United,@united after 443min of avoidable non-weather delays that #Appreciation link better be giving out #GoldenTickets
2066,United,@united where is our luggage
2067,United,@united we just left @flySFO (delayed). http://t.co/XzBAjMiekx
2068,United,@united all set. Figured it out at the baggage office!
2069,United,@united screws up again...to be expected! NEVER AGAIN!
2070,United,@united why don't you allow families with small children to board first anymore? Our next flight will be on another airline...
2071,United,@united Life goal: complete ‚úîÔ∏è
2072,United,@united I have $20 and I'll draw you a super sweet picture of your choosing. Will that get me round-trip to San Diego? üå¥üå¥ It's so cold here.
2073,United,@united flight Cancelled Flightled to Denver service agent offered me a non jet salt lake to Denver or red eye out of Atlanta then hung up on me.
2074,United,"@united That's called throwing ""loyalty"" out the window and trying to give less awards."
2075,United,"@united your unhelpful team? Sure I did. I'm in Bangkok, my bag in Chicago. Are u going to pay for my accommodation s until my bag arrives??"
2076,United,"@united I'd hardly call going from 10,000 miles to 1,000+ miles a ticket cutting edge. About 1/10 the perk?"
2077,United,@united that's not an apology. Say it.
2078,United,@united Just sent a DM. Thank you for the acknowledgment.
2079,United,@united download jeokoo the American app for air travelers
2080,United,@united been on hold for almost two hours trying to talk to someone about a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning. What do you suggest?
2081,United,@united no apology? Cool.
2082,United,"@united you ask a lot of customers who  you routinely screw over. You know that, right?"
2083,United,@united I'm a first time solo female traveller and it's pretty scary being in a foreign place not knowing where your belongings are...
2084,United,"@united I am. Who knows where my bags are. Do I just wait around and hope they arrive? No one has answers, I have plans and no answers...."
2085,United,@united somehow I knew that you'd wait until I was airborne to respond. #hacks #jokers #neveragain.
2086,United,@united Missing flight attendant = Delayed Flight. Prime example how 1 person impacts 100's of people. HNL -&gt; IAH (UA252) #wastedtime
2087,United,@united has me stranded in Texas and then hangs up on me when I'm trying to figure out how to get home. Cool.
2088,United,@united we have tried to change our flight THREE times on the phone and got disconnected each time.
2089,United,"@united poor showing today, no assistance to passengers who mis connected due to maintenance and waiting for baggage"
2090,United,"@united has been showing the same tone deaf video for all these years about how ""wifi is coming!"" Hah.Not before I leave. @VirginAmerica ftw"
2091,United,@united Can I get a follow? I fly with you for Christmas.
2092,United,"@united more people stranded cause you suck. Better yet, you weasel out of Flight Booking Problems rooms for people claiming weather http://t.co/Flcnnn2USD"
2093,United,@united look at all the delta flights that landed while your pilots claimed they couldn't fly 6232 to JAC. http://t.co/6Kp4m0R1f7
2094,United,@united thank you! Much appreciation for your help.
2095,United,"@united Been sitting on flight 435 for an hour after landing in Newark. First no gate, then no jetway operator. Seriously!?"
2096,United,@united worst customer service experience ever. 40 minutes to get the jetway to the plane at EWR tonight. Flight 354   Disappointed
2097,United,@united - not only 2 hour delay - double booked seat nit parked at wrong gate - incompetence at its finest - been waiting  for over 1 hr
2098,United,@united look at the people tryn to sleep in the airport due to your shitty company not comping rooms after cxl flight http://t.co/o1u96Xc3bo
2099,United,"@United - routing a person from Houston to Newark, NJ  and then to SFO is not acceptable."
2100,United,@united Phone

2107,United,@united I'm still trying to get things worked out and you have yet to respond back.
2108,United,"@united screwed up our reservation- they assigned a new # to just one of us &amp; when they changed our flight, only changed the original #."
2109,United,@united 25 min hold has now progressed to over an hour...919-675-0985
2110,United,@united YOU SUCK!
2111,United,"@united yo, you need a new website really badly. This day and age..."

2113,United,@united how can u not have gate ready or gate agent for going on hour two
2114,United,@united just DM'd
2115,United,@united had a different fiasco on my outward trip and was rebooked on to qantas lax-Syd. No FF miles show up in my account for that :(
2116,United,@united I am following - you need to follow me for DM?
2117,United,@united it would be great to get a callback from the agent that disconnected me trying to put me on hold after waiting to connectfor 60+min
2118,United,"@united not a good day to fly u, two delayed flights still on plane at Ewr waiting over 1,5 hours for gate get to gate no gate agent."
2119,United,@united just called and did it. Should have earlier because I'm being sent to DCA first and THEN to pvd. We may rent a car instead.
2120,United,"@united my luggage is set to go to DCA however, I am rerouted to Dulles. Currently in NOLO however bags are in Houston. Can you fix this?"
2121,United,@united I went from Sacramento to Minneapolis at the end of October 2014 in business class.
2122,United,@united I'm extremely disappointed w my service for this trip as a #United #MileagePlus Explorer Card holder.
2123,United,@united I hope your corporate office is ready to deal with the rage created by your shitty service and bullshit pilots. #UnitedAirlinesSucks
2124,United,@united such a relaxing space for a drink before my flight! (at @United Global First Lounge) https://t.co/j4cj0lrF2d http://t.co/dTLGUQ1kAk
2125,United,@united i will never fly with you again. i went on vacation this week and you lost my bags both ways. now i have no clothes. thankyou
2126,United,@united sadly this wasnt just due to mother nature investigate this incident and your employees at sfo. Terrible customer experience
2127,United,@united flight ua90 is taking off now after 1750 was delayed over 4 hrs 30 passengers to miss their flight to tel aviv
2128,United,@united 30 of us on flight 1750 trying to get to tel aviv that is trying to take off right now with out us so cruel. Next flight is 350pm

2134,United,@united do you expect to Cancelled Flight flights out of @DENAirport tomorrow morning given the storm?
2135,United,@United also ran out of water and refused service #costumerservice #legit #jk
2136,United,@united I have a question
2137,United,@United Can you increase the legroom? : How airlines compare http://t.co/diUfep8n2q via @CNNMoney
2138,United,"@united on a 4 seg flt yvr to zurich, why would you credit all miles and but only 2 segs on full fare?"
2139,United,@united I see two flights with two seats in the morning can we get on those
2140,United,@united 6377 and now they sent our green tagged bags to the luggage carousel. It's been one mess up after another. Bad day @united
2141,United,@united the lounge tells us they have no pillows for my grandma as one of the ladies opens the closet and I see 2 right there. #unitedlies
2142,United,@united the drunk guy you threw out of flight UA936 4hrs ago is better off than the rest of us held up for 5hrs in the plane without food.
2143,United,"@united sitting in Denver airport waiting for a plane to be refueled. For an hour and a half! Hurry the fuck up United, you fucking retards"
2144,United,@united we will be at the airport first thing in the morning
2145,United,@united I'm rebooked on a flight tomorrow even though I had 1st class seat orig I have a lousy coach seat
2146,United,@united well this one missed the mark.  She was in a snit from the minute I stepped up to the counter
2147,United,@united Doesn't have to be same flight 2 and 2 will work also
2148,United,@united who compensates is for the delays caused by the fact that you don't have enough flight attendants?? http://t.co/96apr35qan
2149,United,@united we've been seating for 5hrs inside flight UA936 at #IAD delayed. We've only been offered water &amp; cookies in business class. #failed
2150,United,@united please get me off this plane #UA57
2151,United,@united yes. On a nonstop to Memphis tomorrow morning. With the snow coming in I got my fingers crossed it will go.
2152,United,@united traveling with 3 young kids!! Chose our original flights for a reason.
2153,United,@united have since dropped to 2 layovers but still not acceptable.
2154,United,@united our 1 layover itinerary was swapped for a 3 layover itinerary - really?!?
2155,United,"@united your app says flight UA936 to #ZRH departed 2:45hrs Late Flight, but 5 hours Late Flightr we are still seating inside the plane in #IAD.  #failed"
2156,United,@united not completely.  Our flight was changed in July but we never received notification.
2157,United,@united are there any upgrades avail to get us all on the same flight
2158,United,@united Wife and I have two new destinations and I'm stuck in DC until Monday with no bags
2159,United,@united no I don't. Spoke with baggage contact at 1-800 number. Said they will try to get bags to stay at IAD for pick up tmrw
2160,United,@united can you make sure I‚Äôm on the upgrade list for 2/23 EWR-PDX using my GPU priority? Got a weird email about it.
2161,United,@united so is that two seats avail so far for us.
2162,United,@united has once again earned a place as the worst airline in the business
2163,United,@united is flight number 1142 Denver to Las Vegas 1125 on Sunday feb 22 Cancelled Flighted ?
2164,United,"@united when I read it say ' in some cases' can you please define this for me, when for example would it not be the case?"
2165,United,@united I'm trying your WiFi on UA1616. But sorry it really slow. Even #Spotify lagging and that isn't a hard stream.
2166,United,"@united Not until tomorrow night. And the hotel voucher had higher rate than travelocity Not loving cost, but hard working staff"
2167,United,"@united flight UA1459 sitting at newark waiting for a gate, seriously??? #threehoursLate Flight"
2168,United,@united why don't you ever print my known #traveler number on my ticket? Because of this I never get to use the #TSA prescreen I paid for
2169,United,"@united boarding was decent, 3 useless agents that don't speak English (after 2.5hrs of hold) 6hrs of mech delay not so much"
2170,United,"@united After all I have been through on this trip, can you get me on another airline home?"
2171,United,@united flight was Cancelled Flighted after the last opportunity to rebook us on other flights this evening passed.
2172,United,@united boarding a #plane would be much faster if you boarded back to front instead of front to back #MakesSense #efficiency #travel #flying
2173,United,"@united it's 9:56, and the desk attendant stated we would ""sit awhile"" until given the all clear. Lack of communication seems to the norm."
2174,United,@united had been suffering immensely ever since this merge .. Hopefully I'll never have to fly @united ever again ..
2175,United,@united I'd really like to get off of this plane now.
2176,United,@united possibly the worst airlineGave them three chances Second time in 2 weeks a flight has been delayed and or Cancelled Flightled due to mechanics
2177,United,@united cabin pressurization issues are pretty serious. Flight 1109 landed in Washington because of it. My head is pounding.
2178,United,@united Sandra at ur international checkin counter was rude and offensive.  She commented she didn't care if I complained cuz she had 25yrs
2179,United,@united My contact stuff is in the bag and I'm legally blind. This is so messed up.
2180,United,@united Did I mention that I was ON THE PLANE so is my luggage. My luggage that I'm not going to have for how many days.
2181,United,@united 3 times I've called customer services each at least 40 mins... Each time cut off by your operators... Why can't you call me back!
2182,United,@united Tell me that you're at least going to cover a room and get me out of here.
2183,United,@united OMG!!! you just bumped me off the last flight. Can this get any worse.
2184,United,@united Which just speaks to basically the worst designed web system ever.
2185,United,"@united Yeah, I tried that about 10 times for two different tickets, and it told me to ""Try again Late Flightr""."
2186,United,@united please fire the captain of flight 6232 today. He single handedly ruined every passengers day by being a piece of shit. #unitedsucks
2187,United,@united U blow
2188,United,@united what exactly do you hang on this hook? http://t.co/ZHxOk07Aqa
2189,United,"@United - flight Cancelled Flightled. 4 hrs at airport to book a new one for $95. Just got two invoices for the flight, each for approx $300. Really?!"
2190,United,@united why do you hire POS pilots? Thanks for ruining my trip and not allowing me to see my buddy as he turns 30. #unitedsucksdick
2191,United,.@united Your airline is again rated the WORST in America so you've got your work cut out for you. It's bc you treat customers like garbage.
2192,United,@united what's the best way to get your tickets? Print off at home or go to check in desk?
2193,United,@united Pay for my hotel.... I'm a broke student #help
2194,United,@united all 4 of us are on standby in Houston tomorrow for flights to Calgary. If you could get us on one or two of those that would help
2195,United,@united what a nightmare!!  Both sides of my flights are a disaster!  At Houston getting attitude cuz I was sent to ticket counter
2196,United,@united you're terrible.
2197,United,@united it was eventually explained that weather conditions too extreme to get luggage off planes. Will be sent on. But I won't be for days!
2198,United,@united Anyone there? Did you read my DM?
2199,United,@united 732 from Denver. We just boarded! Fingers crossed we get into the air!!!
2200,United,"@united EWR TO MCO made unplanned landing because of pressurization failure. Worst pain I've EVER felt, I thought I was going to pass out"
2201,United,@united How does that make a flight takeoff on time? And regardless it makes me Late Flight because now I have to wait for my bag at baggage claim.
2202,United,@united it's been over 3 hours...at what point do you let people off of the plane? @FoxNews @CNN @msnbc
2203,United,@united trying to get a customer service agent.  Just landed in SFO.  Can't fly with 3 layovers with 3 kids!!
2204,United,@united why are there no early morning flights from HNL to anywhere in the continental US? Example- Monday 4/20. Need flight to PHL
2205,United,@united nope I gave up - maybe they'll deliver it
2206,United,@united Thanks for the upgrade- please try to get my company to approve more business class travel.
2207,United,@united more and more delays! No CS help at all! No notifications!
2208,United,@united and waiting
2209,United,@united hoping there is a spare a/c for 1171 tomorrow!  Have a ship to board!  The sched aircraft is delayed from previous flts.
2210,United,@united Hubby made it by the skin of his teeth!   :)
2211,United,@united the incompetence is truly stunning at this point. 4 hours on a plane for a 1.75 hour nonstop flight.
2212,United,"@united 1st u delay my flight for mechanical failure,then 2 hrs on the runway, &amp; 13 hrs Late Flightr I'm still here with a lost bag &amp; no resolution"
2213,United,@united is the worst
2214,United,@united still waiting
2215,United,"@united thanks for the reply. To clarify, the airfare is similar to your likely intended peer group. The $3 beer charge, however, is not"
2216,United,"@united...lies lies lies....still sitting at the gate, have not moved an inch http://t.co/LulGnwEfFH"
2217,United,"@united I have requested upgrade for EWR BOM flight, end of May. Miles + copay. When will i know if I am upgraded?"
2218,United,@united &amp; finally he was told he couldnt use the front of plane restrm (he was row7) though myself/others in rows behind him used w/no issue
2219,United,"@united #customerservice at @Dulles_Airport could not be worse. I get the bad weather, but this is awful."
2220,United,@united any plans of restating nonstop service between IAD and South Florida?  We miss our flights to FLL.
2221,United,"@united instead of be told when we board, we have to wait for the emails telling us about the delays."
2222,United,"@united Additionally, my husband paid for tv service &amp; it stopped working about halfway through the flight."
2223,United,@united following
2224,United,"@united unfortunately, they didn't. I asked the staff if they could help. they said we should ask ppl in our row to switch, but no one would"
2225,United,@united please update what is going to happen to passengers now that flt ua14 has been Cancelled Flightled
2226,United,@united your baggage person told me to go through @AirCanada - they're handling my connecting flight.
2227,United,@united I sent a PM over two weeks ago and have heard nothing!  #horribleservice #unitedsucks
2228,United,"@united Well, to the degree that he could... Just to know, after this experience I'm Cancelled Flighting my miles card. Thank god for @Delta"

2236,United,@united is there another airport closer to Calgary we can fly out of tomorrow.
2237,United,@united Nope! I'm on UA 174 that was supposed to leave at 6:47 but are still at the gate. Apparently we are about to pull back and de-ice.
2238,United,"@united Still do not have my bag, it's in the CLT airport. Was originally told I would have it by 2pm."
2239,United,@united Yes. About an hour after landing.
2240,United,@united just texted me to say flight is delayed due to air traffic control. BS! They pulled the plane in Late Flight #lies
2241,United,@united 6 minutes to boarding at b12 in Ord. No sign of gate agent. A little help?
2242,United,@united On flight 1220 right now...

2251,United,@united Flight has been delayed for another hour so only have 24 mins to transit at LAX... Extremely unlikely I will make it!
2252,United,@united 4595. We are now going back to the gate b/c of something overheating after sitting out here for 3+ hours.Love United but this stinks
2253,United,@united congratulations united. Fail again. Sky at a gate with a plane full of people waiting on 2. Weather gets worse now we can't leave.
2254,United,"@united thank you for leaving my bag in houston! despite what your system says, i was definitely on the flight!"
2255,United,@united how come a $27 shuttle bus from LGA to EWR has electrical power outlets but our new Airbus interiors do not? #whyjeff?
2256,United,Reply to @united - Doesn't do any good to check outlets preflight when moved to different equipment after boarding due to malfunction.
2257,United,@united 15-hr flight w/broken #Dreamliner media system. Witness #mental #breakdown as we bounce off walls. Remind me why I'm 1K.
2258,United,@united I was rebooked thru SFO but arrive 9 hours Late Flight and miss activities. I asked to fly today with stop over. Was told I'd have to pay.
2259,United,@united never again.
2260,United,@united tonight you made this Fred Flintstone happy with an upgrade to 1st class. http://t.co/gKgKZLAwpR
2261,United,@united who do I need to contact regrading a complaint and to get a voucher funds for future travel on United?
2262,United,@united is trying to strand us in Houston until tomorrow morning. pretty sure overFlight Booking Problems and maintenance aren't our fault.
2263,United,@united  your costumer service today in the Providence airport was sucked. Recommend your airline learn to check the weather and be honest
2264,United,@united fire yr rep who refused to put me on a flight that I had a boarding pass and seat on. Full explanation and her name in complaint.
2265,United,@united that's great! pls let me know when u start!
2266,United,@united @ehsanisMpowered lmfao
2267,United,"@united God damn fucking crew won't be here till 6:40, so you've known for over an hour and a half the flight time was bullshit."
2268,United,@united you really do have a culture problem. Everyone I tried to work with blamed someone else or told me how they're short staffed
2269,United,@united sucks.
2270,United,@united I can understand that but to not have another plane available when there is a full day till departure is unacceptable. Phoenix?
2271,United,@united is honestly RUINING MY FUCKING LIFE RIGHT NOW. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2272,United,@united Flight Cancelled Flightled to BDL and stranded @Dulles_Airport. Waiting almost 2hrs at customer service. Shout out to diligent agents.
2273,United,@united where's the crew for ua748?
2274,United,@united thanks ... not sure arranged move to the earlier flight but I'm at the gate with a seat assignment.  Super nice agent at gate C4 ORD
2275,United,@united quality work going on here. http://t.co/9xbO5daKaK
2276,United,@united No customer service rep could confirm where my bag was &amp; each gave me different info. Ruined 2 events I had today. #disappointed
2277,United,@united We've let you know how to help the millions of customers you've treated like garbage. It's no coincidence ur ranked WORST airline.
2278,United,"@united yes, after landing at 930pm last night. Spoke to 10 baggage claim customer service reps. Finally spoke to one amazing ticket agent."
2279,United,@united Charging $6500 for biz flight to UK = somewhat egregious. Charging $3 on top for a Sam Adams draft at the United Club is usurious.
2280,United,@united I see. Thanks for explaining.
2281,United,@united Your social listening capabilities are awful if this is the reply for the context in which you were mentioned @stevelord212
2282,United,@united If you follow me I will DM you my phone # which you can call.
2283,United,"@united After an hour+ wait, my issue is resolved. I did contact customer service to comment on the wait time. Thanks for contacting me."
2284,United,"@united Yes, they did. Must have fixed the broken ramp. Thanks!"
2285,United,@united Flight:UA1750 is basically a prison on the runway @ SFO 6delays 4hrs of sitting no water no answers. reminded y I hate this airline
2286,United,@united thanks

2353,United,@united not sure why u call it customer care.  Should be customer we don't care

2355,United,@united I fly @AmericanAir normally.  This doesn't happen to me with them.  I'll let your flyers provide their own feedback. Thank you.
2356,United,@united the upgrade to first class was a nice way to fix your earlier mistake. Thank you!
2357,United,@united how about plowing the snow at a gate before the plane arrives so we don't sit for 45 minutes after an 8 hr flight.... Fail
2358,United,@united SATURDAY this morning Man dies from Ebola http://t.co/hXVVIS0VWw
2359,United,@united Rhonda C. at Atlanta airport redeemed you guys. She got us straightened out.

2365,United,@united now been on board with no movement for 25 min...wow this experience just keeps getting worse and worse
2366,United,@united have an employee at the gate 15min before boarding like u expect ur customers to. Be a competent company like ur rivals

2371,United,"@united I haven't booked yet, I'm asking before I book"

2373,United,"@united Luckily, I had my disinfectant wipes and did your job for you. You're welcome. #badservice"
2374,United,@united You really should clean the food and coffee stains off of the area around the seats when new passengers come aboard. Gross!
2375,United,@united cldnt be happier w the many plastic wing pins given to me on flight 494. I love them! Amazing staff! So nice http://t.co/CbV7f3KBKx
2376,United,@united since UA 1226 ORD-EWR is delayed pushing it into meal time does that mean it will be catered with meals in First?
2377,United,@united help? Invest more in your planes and your people and less in stock buybacks and executive pay. Maybe then you would not disappoint.

2389,United,@united thank you for your reply.  My frustration is that spending a upgrade just puts you on a wait  list.
2390,United,@united @nathankillam or your staff could try not throwing the luggage around.
2391,United,@united 4 of us are stranded   And flying from New Orleans to Huston tonight and we will be stuck there for two days. Rather fly than wait.

2406,United,@United my flight from MCO has been delayed &amp; scheduled to arrive after my connection departs. What options do I have?
2407,United,@united is not a company that values it's customer &amp; after reading tweets to them I'm not the only one who feels that way #lostmybusiness
2408,United,"@united I was insulted, disrespected and met with incompetence at every turn how about a voucher for a domestic round trip"
2409,United,@united. DAY to IAD and CVG to IAD both Cancelled Flightled by United but all other airlines operating. Friend stuck and now miss intl flight. Help?

2472,United,@united once again your lack of customer service astounds me! You are the worst airline in the history of airlines! Train your staff!

2474,United,"@united besides landing the plane, overall customer service experience has been poor. Late Flight and rude workers plus missing luggage"

2490,United,"@united really needs to start upgrading their planes. No TVs &amp; then the ""inflight wifi"" is currently unavailable #UnitedAirlines"
2491,United,@united I am not digging the new mileage earning plan. I would earn about 1/3 of the miles I do now. Any changes to the award ticket prices?
2492,United,@united outsourcing ticket and gate agents at MIA. Ill advised. You did it in ROC and service went downhill. Keep employees and fliers first
2493,United,@united Was just hung up on by customer service after waiting 30 min on hold...guess that vacation's not happening? Website wasn't working.
2494,United,@united bad idea to let 200 people back on the terminal with food vouchers but allow only 15 minutes to get anything.  Long lines!! #ua1523
2495,United,@united what's going on with the mileage plus accounts? Login through username and email have been down for at least three days.

2508,United,"@united diverged to Burlington, Vermont. This sucks."
2509,United,@united officially has the most inefficient boarding procedure. There is no reason it should take 45 mins to board a plane!
2510,United,@united 3 hours of sitting in the plane that hasn't left the Gate yet. 6 more hours of actual flying left.
2511,United,@united I sent my details to the customer care link you sent me almost a month ago and no response.

2517,United,@united I'm afraid not... I fly or service every week and I'm just unhappy..spend too much money to be unhappy
2518,United,"@united thank you.
It's my daughters 13th bd party w/proj. weather cond, it doesn't look promising.
Please assist with earlier flts to Cmh?"
2519,United,"@united if you're going to Cancelled Flight flights today, do everyone a favor and get on it now. Don't stall the inevitable."
2520,United,@united your plane's been waiting at the Gate for two hours with all passengers onboard in their cramped seats. Yuck.
2521,United,"@united 
Flight UA1665 got delayed 2 hours due to a mechanical issue...could use a free drink or 3 to make up for this inconvenience"
2522,United,@united his cell phone record needs to be checked to see who did conversed with. I trust the FAA can handle this better.
2523,United,@united 15.99 for wireless?  Was 6.99 epic #fail . #greedy #piggy you are the worst!
2524,United,@united have you inspected the picture? routine aircraft check while on his cell phone? What will the FAA &amp; NYT say ? http://t.co/bNgpli8JT6
2525,United,"@united your ""Airserv"" contractors aren't worth a wet damn. 30min Late Flight, still not done w bags on UA1566. They made checkin a calamity."
2526,United,@united Will never fly with you again! Terrible service!! Ruined our entire vacation!! #lostsuitcase #noreimbursement
2527,United,"@united web app won't let me upgrade seats, call center wait time is 20 minutes plus, just want to get more legroom but it's a pita"
2528,United,@united 132 characters does not cover my reasons I'm afraid
2529,United,@united while busy on his cell phone ???
2530,United,"@united really, fill out a form about my flight experience? I sent an email to the 1K email address."
2531,United,"@united: ""Left gate 5 minutes early."" 
My thoughts: ""That doesn't count if you sit on the Tarmac for a half hour."" #comeonpeople"
2532,United,@united will the kudos to capt. Herman be relayed to his chief pilot or should I be emailing someone?
2533,United,@united on flight 1665 but it's not departing! Website says delayed due to operational difficulties-what does that mean?
2534,United,"@united do you teach your gate agents 2 lie? Or do they just learn on their own? There was overhead space for my bag,  didn't have to check"
2535,United,@united First Officer of UA 1514 checking our 757 prior to departure from EWR yesterday while on his cell. Safety ??? http://t.co/1TFH2v0a7z
2536,United,@united i booked lh via ua.  However at gate they rebooked me to a Late Flightr lh flight.  Now that flight didnt earn pqd for me.  How do i get it
2537,United,@united coupled with self-service policies/cost cutting exacerbates the noted issues. (3/3)
2538,United,"@united I appreciate the immediate offer, but suspect it is more long-term issue/not simple fix. Also, ski/bootbag policy is awkward at best"
2539,United,"@united It isnt simple issue, generally how you set up check in/baggage policies at Logan and general unhelpfulness of employees in early AM"
2540,United,@United terrible illogical re-route after Cancelled Flightled connection. Then made me pay to check bag. Then lost bag. #ual
2541,United,@united I already follow you. One of you 800-number agents rebooked me. Went from a 777 to an a320. Ugh.

2560,United,"@united  UA 1706 there is no way a plane ""loses its software"" I believe you decided to do an upgrade..."
2561,United,@united already missed connection... UA 495
2562,United,@united typically once you get the problem fixed - then the crew expires - and the delay turns into a Cancelled Flight...
2563,United,"@united UA 1706 delayed again - I get charged $600 if Late Flight by you - you say ""oh well"""
2564,United,@united we are trying to go as far away from King'sCollegeLondon as possible for #charity today. Would you help us ? #jailbreak #RAG

2596,United,"@united funny, both my flights yesterday were delayed because of mechanical issues. Rotten luck to get 2 planes in a row with ""issues""..."
2597,United,@united that would have been nice earlier  today. Too Late Flight now. I hope.

2610,United,"@united I have a voucher that expires next week, can I get an extension on it before it expires?"
2611,United,"@united sure, but 8 different texts changing time &amp; gate (especially locations across the entire concourse). That just seemed a little off."

2662,United,"@united It wasn't full, I had plenty of time to go to the gate and check, plus with my status I should have gotten on!?!"
2663,United,@united Then why did your staff refuse to let ME on the earlier flight citing my having checked a bag?!?!
2664,United,"@united Thanks for nothing. Next time I'll bring a whole extra suitcase for my 1 extra pound. That makes sense, right?"
2665,United,"@united first you lost all my bags, now you Cancelled Flight my flight home. 30 min wait to talk to somebody #poorservice #notgoodenough"

2676,United,@united you're right. Good you caught the mechanical failure. Too bad there are no blankets. But ok.
2677,United,@united - we're sitting in UA1088 getting delayed because the operations can't find captain. #ridiculous #united

2679,United,@united. You guys made my day. Treated me well. Thank you!!!
2680,United,@united Stuck in Houston because you can't seem to get a plane to the destination on time in perfect flying conditions.

2697,United,@united thank you for 7 hrs at terminal D in Dulles airport http://t.co/IG2dgctt2M

2699,United,@united landing in Chicago - saw it once we were already airborne.
2700,United,"@united Marcus helped me - good agent, couldn't fix it. Flight was listed on website, but ""unavailable""to book. False advertising much?"
2701,United,"@united I may not hit any new status this year, but I‚Äôve flown several times this year and have tried to book with y‚Äôall every time!"
2702,United,"@united unsmiling rep. told us hotel shuttle comes ""like every 15 minutes."" Breezy 30 min. Late Flightr we're taking a cab. You going to reimburse?"
2703,United,"@united If someone misses his connecting flight because of the airline, and it was the last flight of the day, how will you fix it?"
2704,United,@united Yes I needed plenty of assistance but received none.
2705,United,"@united not tonight, we got a hotel and after 14hrs of traveling and still not reaching our destination we are disappointed. Thanks"
2706,United,@united thank you for the reply. I emailed your customer care department about my experience.
2707,United,@united How can I file a claim when your agents won't let me speak to a supervisor? My claim number is expired because you WON'T find my bag
2708,United,@united it's done.  If you do something to make up for it I'll tweet that too.
2709,United,@united I had one interview I was the last person what does that mean?
2710,United,@united I have flown with you 10 times in the last 13 days. 8 out of 10 flights have been delayed. Huge mistake on my part. Don't fly united
2711,United,@united I just received notification of in-flight Wi-Fi for UA863 from @flySFO to @SydneyAirport. Amazing!
2712,United,@united yes but taking two days to get bag delivered. Missed a full day skiing because of this.

2714,United,@united she's the type of person that can make a customers day! I fly 100+ times a year &amp; she's one of the top flight attendants I've had!
2715,United,@united made me remove 1 pound from my checked bag otherwise they would charge me $200. Loyal flier for 10 years - time for change.

2723,United,@united Thank You
2724,United,"@united, if you mean beyond opaque ""maintenance issues"", yes, that would be  basic in customer service which your EWR staff can't manage."
2725,United,"@united ""Dear Ted. We don't care about you nor the Mileage Plus Card you pay a lot for. Bye bye. -- United"""

2729,United,@united - #epicfail from a former gate agent in PIA!  He walked away and quit! Luckily a responsible PIA agent saved the day!
2730,United,@united That was the problem.  We were being told the aircraft was on its way.
2731,United,@united will do. Thx. Been sitting on plane now for 2.5 hrs and now we have to refuel!  I can't even make this stuff up.
2732,United,@united do you know how to use twitter bro?  Your terminal looks like it's in Bosnia.  Here's another pic. http://t.co/M9Nywr5Kbs
2733,United,@united you are by far the worst airline. 4 plane delays on 1 round trip flight. How is that possible.
2734,United,@united I took care of it myself. Had to rent a car and drive 3 hours to retrieve my belongings. Due to united errors.
2735,United,@united now I'll probably miss my next connection!
2736,United,@united any chance you'll ever do CPUs on your JFK-LAX like @AmericanAir?
2737,United,@united you may think I'm joking or blowing it out of proportion but the last 8 united flights have been delayed or significantly Late Flight.
2738,United,"@united not the case. Now delayed due to ""mechanical issues with no update on departure time"". Just Cancelled Flight the goddamn flight so I go delta"
2739,United,@united 2 days and 3 planes with mechanical issues?  Now over 1.5 hrs Late Flight sitting on this plane. This is insane!!

2741,United,"@united Yes, filled out the form last year. Don't have case number handy. Guess I'm not cut out for the historical society afterall"
2742,United,@United What idiot designed your seats? Armrest TV remote &amp; resting elbows don't mix. Seatmate keeps changing channels &amp; blasting volume.
2743,United,@united You can bump me up to Group 3 so I won't be forced to check my bag and wait 30+ minutes at LGA.
2744,United,"@united Listen, learn &amp; do this: Remove your PQD requirement. It is insulting. ^HA"
2745,United,@united thank you for the reply.  I will fill out the form and submit it as requested.  Good to know you're paying attention!
2746,United,@united Gate Agent Alavera is amazing
2747,United,@united I need you...to be a better airline. ^LOL
2748,United,@united your agents forced me to check a carry on bag. When I received my bag I found your crew had stolen from me. U lost my business!
2749,United,@united wins top marks for customer service via Twitter. They turned a poor experience into a positive. Many thanks for the effort! üëç
2750,United,@united Really....you charge me $25 to check a bag and then you put it on a different flight....still Don't have my bag!!!
2751,United,@united Why haven't you released a travel advisory for IAD for tomorrow????!!!!!!!!

2754,United,@united I just had an interview how long does it take before you hear back
2755,United,@united I think problem resolution should be decided on your end. Especially if you'd like me to continue flying your airline.
2756,United,@united roundtrip to London on @Delta ? I think I will! FYI that's another $1k you just lost. #moneynotspentonunited #unfriendlyskies

2759,United,"@united Also, group 5 is total BS."
2760,United,@united Don't ask me to be patient without offering something in return.
2761,United,"@united just like clockwork, Friday afternoon flights from LAS to DEN running Late Flight. Why does this seem to happen so consistently #KeepIt100"
2762,United,@united I will! On @AmericanAir @SouthwestAir @Delta or @JetBlue  all of which will be getting my business. #unfriendlyskies #unbelievable
2763,United,@united free booze for the Bach party would make it better!  ORD--&gt;MSY #Delayed #Again   We will enjoy either way.  Thanks!
2764,United,"@united (2/2) I have their name (boarding pass was in there, too).  I think they might really need this. Any ideas?"
2765,United,@united - sitting in seat 10D on a flight back from Vegas to Chicago.  Someone left a folder that looks important in the seat pocket. (1/2)
2766,United,"@united incompetent/rude service today. Missed my connecting flight, then the customer service desk was terrible to me. Really upset w untd."
2767,United,@united - terrible experience on UA415 on 17th. 1st exit row in economy has zero legroom. Have same row booked for return but can't change.
2768,United,@united 5.5 hours Late Flightr I've been in transit for a total of twelve hours...please just change the plane on flight 600 this is ridiculous SFO
2769,United,@united all good man it isn't your fault that plane is having maintenance issues

2775,United,@united Existing reservation is fine. I was talking about no longer having an 0600 CMH-ORD option. 0638 gets me in too Late Flight.

2778,United,"@united I know. I‚Äôm sure you hear it all the time ‚Äî don‚Äôt like the new seats. I‚Äôm a small guy, 5‚Äô 6‚Äù and I feel the new planes are tight"
2779,United,@united how about after 2.5 hrs at ORD another .5 on the tarmac + refuse to move me to an earlier flight you make it up to me? #iflyalot #bs
2780,United,"@united OK, thanks for the clarification."
2781,United,@united When are you coming back to @IFlyOAKland? You have a huge East Bay customer base due to SFO and *I* miss you!
2782,United,@united also doesn't help me. I'm a very frequent flier and united premiere gold. Apparently that means nothing.
2783,United,@united delayed another hour
2784,United,@united as a million mile flier I'm embarrassed to ask how long ago his launched?
2785,United,@united Can't beat the storm out of town if you wait to issue the policy until too Late Flight.  NWS issued storm warning already...

2787,United,"@united don't need your apologies, need my bag. Took 56 minutes from landing to get it. Unacceptable."
2788,United,"@united add wifi, entertainment and the old seats and i‚Äôll come back."
2789,United,@united so we fly into SFO and Honululu gets pushed back 3.5 hours and now it looks like more delays.  I beg of you plz sort this out soon!
2790,United,@united : thanks! i will catch my conection! :)
2791,United,@United super lame that you charge $8 for tv on an international flight to the US. It isn‚Äôt 1997!
2792,United,"@united as for volunteers to give up seats, people did! Now we sit for 25 minutes on plane waiting 4 them to add more people!  #letsgo"
2793,United,@united 4016 529557.   You going to transfer my car to me too?  Because it's at the airport you couldn't get me too...
2794,United,"@united next time I will not volunteer to let you gate check my bag for space, since you obviously can't deliver it in a timely manner."
2795,United,"@united I'm sorry it's cold in chicago, but I don't see why that means it takes 45 minutes for my priority bag to show up on the carousel."
2796,United,@united how long does it take for customer feedback to respond to a complaint?
2797,United,@united you are making me miss big snow in Montana. Not cool.
2798,United,@united you might be the only airline not offering waivers...keep up the good fight
2799,United,@united or frontier ... http://t.co/n8WiNFu6C5
2800,United,@united Thank you. Any help is appreciated.
2801,United,"@united FYI, went through this on similar flight last week."

2803,United,@united Bag MIA since Wednesday. Still no word where it is or if we'll ever see it again. #lostluggage #frustrated
2804,United,@united assume those benefits only apply to my own reservation. Any way my partner (on diff res) can use them? Can we combine res?

2810,United,@United you need to get it together 3 of 4 flights Cancelled Flightled stranded with no car and my baggage is lost!  You NEVER get it right.
2811,United,"@united blood services, make your appt. today! 18009174929 http://t.co/6UXwPaduGS"
2812,United,".@united It's worth saying that, if you litter in Singapore, you get caned. ""But there are rules"" says @united"
2813,United,"@united Not waiving change fees with the snow storm coming tomorrow? IAD is under Winter Storm warning tomorrow already, what's up?"
2814,United,@united yes! I'll be sending an email to customer service today.
2815,United,"@united I'm fully aware, it's just that your rules are harsh toward the client. Especially since you're going to resell my seat for more $."
2816,United,@united why I won't check my carry on. Watched a handler throw this bag -- miss the conveyer belt -- sat there 10 min http://t.co/lyoocx5mSH
2817,United,@united why? So I can waste more of time on this airline to get an automated message? Disappointing as always.
2818,United,@united this means within one week i will have filed 2 compensation complaints to your website
2819,United,"@united not 100% sure, however my ticket included one checked bag, therefore this charge was extra and completely unanticipated."
2820,United,‚Äú@united: @d_goodspeed We will follow up with our Maintenance team. Thanks for the tweet. ^KP‚Äù THANK YOU!  United Cares!
2821,United,@united Terribly disappointed. Confirmed reservation delayed and your cust. service staff was not helpful in finding an alternate solution.
2822,United,@united this is for a check-in luggage. Employee told me not to include wheels in the dimensions.
2823,United,@united dmangen@visualclubconcepts.com
2824,United,"@united if I had a ticket refunded which I purchased, for my brother to fly...could I then used the refunded credit for me to fly? Respond"
2825,United,@united this is besides the fact that one week ago you delayed me by 18 hours. i am not impressed at all.
2826,United,"@united its my one and only checked bag, which is checked to edinburgh, however i am being charged randomly from dc to newark"
2827,United,@united with the purchase of my ticket i am entitled to check in 1 bag however i am being charged an extra 25 dollars for domestic transport
2828,United,"@united Thank U for the 1hr delay then boarding us onto a plane that reeks of vomit, flight attendant indicated it wasn't cleaned properly."

2838,United,@united exactly
2839,United,@united the passengers waited inside the flight on the runway and returned back in o gate that should not count as a valid journey
2840,United,"@united yes it is partly used, the del-ewr is used, the return flight was Cancelled Flightled due to technical glitch in operations"
2841,United,@united thank you.. Appreciate the response

2846,United,@united Another terrible experience with United. Discrimination. Delays. And no help from customer service #united #notimpressed
2847,United,"@united Hi, we are flying into IAD tomorrow evening. Do you expect delays or Cancelled Flightlations with the snow storm?"
2848,United,"@united If a business decision is made that inconveniences and possibly causes lost customers, is it a good business decision? #Cranky"
2849,United,@united sent a DM just now. Thanks I am incredibly happy the fast response I got via Twitter than via customer care. Thank you
2850,United,@united please provide update on UA 791. This flight has been stranded by united with no information from the crew on the plane.

2856,United,@united your customer service is crap.
2857,United,@united thanks for having ground crews that are surprised when flights arrive. #beingsuckontarmacsucks!
2858,United,@united mechanical issue. Looks like they got it fixed! Thanks for your concern.
2859,United,@united UA1023 sitting on Tarmac at ORD when there are visibly gates open. Reassign our gate.
2860,United,@united thanks
2861,United,@united Usually an issue with Express our of SFO. Positive note: Mainline p.s. was enjoyable.
2862,United,"@united No. SATO rebooked me. Just upset that my travel office had to fix this, and you couldn't."
2863,United,@united kind of unnerving to watch the guy deicing your plane text on his phone the whole time http://t.co/QdXfT9qqT9
2864,United,@united refreshes my browser right before checkout.error load message. Ticket price increased $358 in a matter of sec. DoUNotWantMyBusiness?
2865,United,@united @JedediahBila Why is United voted every year as one of the worst airlines? Do enjoy that title? You should give Jedediah free passes
2866,United,@united I think you should board from the back of the plane #whatstheholdup #CHItoCLE
2867,United,@united On the plane but thanks! Maybe don't let so many people check in by themselves - teeming with morons.
2868,United,@united Thanks...seat made for a 6 year old and a broken TV. 20 flights/year...my last on your airline.
2869,United,@united UA6357 needs de-icing! Stat! We've waited our turn...
2870,United,@united yes I've boarded this way many times &amp; have never had to show my pass on the Tarmac multiple times. Path was railed off. Only 1 way
2871,United,"@united @bobwesson fair enough United. everybody is doing the best they can. Although that ""slight delay"" is turning into a Cancelled Flightlation."
2872,United,@united Still waiting on our bag! Never got delivered yesterday. Can't reach a real person for help. Sending DM with ref number.
2873,United,@united worst flight experience I've ever had. Will never ever fly your airline again.
2874,United,@united why do I have to go thru the details of the flight I want w/ the recording to then repeat ALL when a real person gets on the line?
2875,United,@united Looks like they came through. Thanks again for the help.
2876,United,@united anything yet JJ?
2877,United,@united why would a person take hours and hours of wait time just to tell a lie
2878,United,@united hey! DM not working. UA 307!
2879,United,@united the refund team is far from customer care courtesy they need training on work ethics. So it's like sir u r lying how can I help
2880,United,@united splitting up my flights quadruples the price
2881,United,@united contd... I am being told that I am asking for a refund on a used ticket on a flight that got Cancelled Flightled how is the ticket used?
2882,United,@united after several trials and several hours of waiting on phone to contact customer care to get my refund all I get is cold shoulder
2883,United,@united I booked and paid for a flight to get me to Denver at a specific time for a meeting. You failed... It wasn't caused by weather
2884,United,@united since when did you get so good again!  4 transcontinental flights in 72h.  What a pleasure/relief you were.
2885,United,@united what I don't understand isn't flight that I paid premium for getting Cancelled Flighted and the best you can do is next available flight...
2886,United,"@united Flight is awful only one lavatory functioning, and people lining up, bumping, etc. because can't use 1st class bathroom. Ridiculous"
2887,United,@united Are the current on board food menus available anywhere online?

2891,United,@united Thanks!
2892,United,@united thanks for prompt response.  Another hour to enjoy vacation! Perhaps a bug in the app as it still shows 2:55.
2893,United,@united Why can I only apply one travel certificate per itinerary even when I have multiple flights?
2894,United,@united appreciate the sentiment and you were able to get me off the ground;still missed connection
2895,United,"@united I log in, view reservations, try view specific reservation &amp; takes me back to login page,"

2899,United,@united I looked on the email chain and there is not one
2900,United,@united why the hell do my miles expire? Was really looking forward to accruing enough for a free flight in 10 years.
2901,United,@united thanks for more timely updates.
2902,United,@united Do you also want the naming rights to my first child so I can fly home and visit with my mother and avoid more winter depression?
2903,United,@united I'm familiar with the procedure. It wouldn't be the first time #UnitedAirlines lost one of my bags. #unhappytraveler
2904,United,@united I get that. But doing it by giving inaccurate/misleading info doesn't seem like a great way to do it. #hopethegearmakesitintact
2905,United,@united cleaning a regional jet takes an hour?
2906,United,@united Baggage check in and in flight crew the friendliest ever Flight#417 ogg to Lax !!!
2907,United,@united thanks. That means I have 30 minutes to make my international connection to HKG
2908,United,@united @JedediahBila KP I am not traveling - we trying to cheer up Ms. Bila.
2909,United,"@united You just tried to charge $750 for a $539 flight when I tried to make a change over the phone, not including $200 change fee. WTF?"
2910,United,@united Thank you for your offer! All sorted out :-)
2911,United,@united workin on it. Waiting on him to reply.
2912,United,@united Flight 395. Rolling delay of 1 hour 42 minutes
2913,United,@united I believe just customer service. At last post he was at Narita in Tokyo. They sent him to a motel to rest. Said standby maybe 2days
2914,United,@united I think this is the best first class I have ever gotten!!  Denver to LAX and it's wonderful!!!
2915,United,@united of course not. The inflight crew was great!
2916,United,"@united well played, ^LO."
2917,United,@united The pilot of UA475 just landed this plane like he was gently placing us into a pile of whipped cream. Smoothest landing ever.
2918,United,@united your website is a complete joke when using safari!
2919,United,@united the new seats on the Canadaair regional jets just plain suck.
2920,United,@united I'm in another country - please Cancelled Flight my reservation. I've booked through Swiss air
2921,United,@united airlines abuse your expensive video equipment and overcharge you for the privilege http://t.co/SdyLuKR7pt via @robthecameraman

2924,United,@united Did somebody say flight upgrade?
2925,United,@united DM sent.
2926,United,@united how is it tripitPro has accurate delayed dept. times and 2hours Late Flightr I hear the same from you? Just curious
2927,United,"@united I can tell you. Your airline has lost mine and my families business. 
This day and age message through Twitter travels fast."
2928,United,@united trying to reach him for the number. At last they have him on standbye and gave him 1 meal voucher for a potential 2 day standbye!
2929,United,@united this is very disappointing. This is about customer service.
2930,United,"@united boarded 6373 on time, deplaned, and now 100 minutes delay. No transparency during. Can't wait to give up my gold status for AA."
2931,United,@united @44Stocker my wife Sarah stocker did also called but could not connect me to customer service
2932,United,"@united Once again I am victim to the scam that is your SHIT Customer Service, this time the agent hung up on me WTF do you teach your staff"

2934,United,@united nice to know that 3 hours of my time is worth $7.99. Free DirectTV for everyone! Ever hear of preventative maintenance?
2935,United,@united that may be true however after 4 weeks matter is still unresolved and I can not get through to a supervisor or manager to help
2936,United,@united obviously no one knows a darn thing around here.  What are we to do if this does not get resolved? http://t.co/Ph8QJzaPKx
2937,United,"@united so going forward, I shouldn't be Flight Booking Problems Star Alliance flights through the United App?"
2938,United,@united I have those notifications yet the staff on board say that is not accurate and they have no departure time.
2939,United,@united I'm not know if the seats are actually narrower than other seats but they feel like it. Or maybe I'm extra bloated.
2940,United,@united DM sent.  This lack if customer service is getting ridiculous.
2941,United,@united delayed going home AGAIN. Getting really tired of delays.
2942,United,@united a big thanks to ^MN and ^KN or patiently clarifying the United domestic world to me.
2943,United,@united uh - I booked it through the UA website. Why the price change?
2944,United,@united I'm rebooked. Getting home 4 hours Late Flightr then planned. What are the chances I'll ever see my bag again? #unhappytraveler
2945,United,"@united United Club team is A+ &amp; got me a seat Late Flightr. Still, not sure why a last min UAL Cancelled Flightlation costs me $ yet overbooked folks get $?"
2946,United,"@united will flight 5559 to YYC be providing free food when we are allowed back on board  after the ""broken lightbulb"""
2947,United,@united I was not looking for the fare to be returned on the companion flight.  don't understand why an additional $200 fee was necessary.
2948,United,"@united thank you so much, that helps a ton. Whoever is on this Twitter acct today deserves a handshake and a hot chocoLate Flight. #problemsolvers"
2949,United,@united I left headphones in 2A on UA4689 from YHZ-EWR. It's a long shot to see them again. But worth a tweet anyway!
2950,United,@united 129 thousand fans of @JedediahBila are asking you to give her your utmost effort to get her a safe flight with her baggage soon!
2951,United,@united can't wait!!! 787!!! @tpallini http://t.co/oDlall5eDH
2952,United,@united flight 5187 to be specific. The last two were probably 30 feet apart and within sight of each other
2953,United,@united love being told you would issue a refund when you couldn't get us out of the way of a hurricane to have it denied
2954,United,@united Without baggage for 5 days and can't get an update from Houston airport since Monday. Worst service ever!
2955,United,@united yes to three different checkers along the walk to the plane. Overkill
2956,United,@united Bummer. Might have to go with @AmericanAir card instead. TY for response though.
2957,United,"‚Äú@united: @LRuns4Cupcakes Please DM details, we'd like to help if you need assistance. ^KP‚Äù @ClarkHoward #Another #Airlines #Issues"

2959,United,@united please arrange someone at the arriving gate of flight 5957 to Chicago for either a refund or first class upgrade
2960,United,"@united made to check in my carry on from Flight 1449 PBI to Newark. Plane luggage stow not full. U r costing me time, money &amp; aggravation!"

2966,United,@united I hope you have a solution or insurance to cover this issue
2967,United,@united customer service has no solution and now we might miss a show because of them
2968,United,@united deserves to go bankrupt. Just delayed an outbound flight with no info on the connecting flight that we're going to miss
2969,United,@united FLT 3444 delayed because of maintenance - that's fixed but can't board because flight crew didn't stay in boarding area #fail
2970,United,@united not anymore.  Finally was ticketed 5 min before takeoff.  Not sure why the confusion with a full-fare GSA ticket.
2971,United,@united Do miles earned with Explorer card count toward lifetime miles?
2972,United,"@united yes, but they still don't know where it is.  I've been told it might be on a flight, but now no one can confirm it."
2973,United,@united what do I do if something is missing from my checked baggage?
2974,United,"@United wind chill in Ithica -17 degrees, and for the trouble of losing my clothes they give me a t-shirt. I'll burn it for warmth. #united"
2975,United,"@united Aw, thanks for the kind words. Totally makes these extra 6 hours sitting in an airport SOOOO much better."
2976,United,@united Frontier is currently offering their weather exceptions for this weekend. When is United?
2977,United,"@united I will be calling customer service. 2 delayed flights today now, luggage misplaced, a disaster across the board."
2978,United,"@united crew has been notified, passenger moved but water not fixed. Now on tarmac two hours"
2979,United,@united that link is not helpful as it does not put me In touch with management
2980,United,"@united as u might imagine, this former pilot was particularly touched by the gesture. Please let the FO know #keepingtraditionsalive"
2981,United,"@united Delayed CMH to ORD. Ran to gate 1 min b4 connection -door closed no one around. Ignored by 1st agent, 2nd super rude. #thanksunited"
2982,United,"@united @upgrd I guess the Kit Kat looks tasty... not going near that ""sandwich."""
2983,United,@united: Worse - headed to LaGuardia (delayed).  Why is the tray table the size of a mouse pad and the overhead the size on my pocket?

2993,United,"@united Got rebooked on AA.  One question though, do you automatically refund the check baggage fees for flight that was Cancelled Flightled?"
2994,United,@united It is all good -- your 1K team has been nothing short of amazing with everything.
2995,United,@united new flight has me at the window. Kind of ticked off. I pick aisle seats only because I hate window seats. #annoyed #EpicFail
2996,United,@united good fly!! #United #businessFirst

3003,United,@united Will you be issuing an exception policy for Denver for this weekend?
3004,United,"@united I need a breakdown of what the ""international surcharge"" on my flights cover. Please help"
3005,United,@united https://t.co/jpd7NsGRT7. Fyi your staff are telling customers to try other carriers
3006,United,@united couldn't have possibly messed up our trip anymore than they did. Thanks for being such a terrible airline. #disappointed

3014,United,@united haha and you have to clean a plane that was held overnight in a hangar. Sounds lovely. Also don't lie on screensand say it's weather
3015,United,@united no because you will charge me or delay me further. United 1612 still waiting.
3016,United,"@united @Adam_Karren @zj76 how did you save the $200 on checked snowboard? Trying to check in this morning, website wants $200! (prem.gold)"
3017,United,"@united traveling from FRA thru IAD to MCO tomorrow, concerned abt IAD weather. Can't change until advisory issued? Any advice?"
3018,United,@united I did and then she made me feel guilty because it was economy plus and I didn't pay for the extra leg room
3019,United,@united my flight Cancelled Flightled new flight 5012 hopefully will not.
3020,United,@united #4781 Cancelled Flightled. #5102newflight I will be upset if this one Cancelled Flights too. I could have rented a car if they would have been honest.

3022,United,"@united Hi, flight 1051. If I try and book a new one way,  flight departure shows up as 3:55pm which seems accurate."

3024,United,@united Who can I contact about requesting a charity donation? #ThankYou
3025,United,@united WTH be honest with your customers.  This better be the last change or we are driving home.  Has our plane left or not!

3027,United,@united I need a customer service manager to contact me please
3028,United,@united Is flight 5001 really going to leave Newark today?  If not tell us now and I will rent a car.  I do not want to end up stranded.
3029,United,.@united thanks for the reply. I saw that but it's not particularly helpful to a hungry vegetarian not flying those specific flights. SHRUG.
3030,United,@united so funny that my boarding pass said PRIORITY a because clearly I am not a priority to this airline
3031,United,@united I'm sure you will offer me nothing for the inconvenience you have put me through TWICE this month. Tweets don't cut it
3032,United,@united or you'll Cancelled Flight my flight like you just did
3033,United,@united screwing me over twice in one month. Learned my lesson. We are through.
3034,United,@united what's the point of offering a free checked bag of you lose it?
3035,United,"@united Will do, cheers"
3036,United,@united Please send me the link/email to formally compliment Irene in SLC on some of the best customer service ever. #PaxEx

3039,United,@united Hi. My 2/23 flight from CUN-EWR shows a departure of 2:55pm on my United app.  Can you confirm?  Doesn't look correct.  Thanks.
3040,United,"@united flight from vegas to houston Cancelled Flighted this morning ""due to operation"" what does this mean!???? Thank god I woke up early today!"
3041,United,@united Will do! Thanks!
3042,United,@united education of that staff is needed - he also turned away other first class cabin passengers with mileage plus.
3043,United,@united Item (not mine) mysteriously ended up in my checked bag after a #EWR to #YOW flight.  Missing a black box? http://t.co/SJQEmDtQmA
3044,United,@united My guess:flight is going to be Cancelled Flightled because there are 16 empty seats and those who confirmed are not important. #frustrated
3045,United,"@united instead of making  seats smaller/thinner so u can jam more people on a flight,u should concentrate on maint &amp; happy customers"
3046,United,@united I need assistance with pulling your agents' heads out of their asses
3047,United,"@united gates were DEFINITELY NOT FULL. We were parked and wheels were chocked. Customer service called it an ""UNMET ARRIVAL""!!"
3048,United,@united @abigailedge Another glitch??
3049,United,@united in spite of flight delay great customer service provided by Janet and baggage employee Karen. You have 2 wonderful employees United.

3053,United,@united worst airline ever. Thanks for the slew of rude agents and staff making my delayed flights even worse.
3054,United,@united no chance in hell. I'd rather walk. Worst airline ever.
3055,United,@United is the worst major US airline.  More proof: they're boarding the plane with the outside galley door open in 0 degree weather.  Wtf?
3056,United,@united [checked in + boardingpass w/no checkin bagage] guess i'm all set. :-)
3057,United,@united always makes our cross country flights rad. @hemispheresmag here's baby flier Charlotte! #8thtime5MonthsOld http://t.co/kCqnwIXUCm

3062,United,@united just kidding with you I'll send you my stuff now. Thanks
3063,United,@united @FAANews unacceptable practice to leave Cancelled Flighted flight passengers to sleep on cement with no pillows #UA1724 http://t.co/nDTLJ15ZpU
3064,United,@united can u get the crew member that we are waiting on? We were told 40 minutes ago they landed here and they are still not to our gate.
3065,United,@united Flight 6212...massive fail! They delaying to transport a crew member causing many to miss connections! Unreal!
3066,United,@united I had the worst customer experience at Houston intl airport... Your ground support even for @staralliance members is a nightmare
3067,United,@united tremendous. What would you recommend?
3068,United,@united can you help me with a delayed flight as im going to miss my connection?
3069,United,"@united I'm counting on you, please don't let me down! #delayed #again #needtocatchmynextflight #alreadyrebookedonce"
3070,United,@United why is it so impossible to actually get a passenger AND their luggage to their final destination?

3078,United,@united what is going on with baggage claim in Newark!#tiredandwanttogohome
3079,United,@united usually your lounge staff are fantastic! Except today in MCO where almost denied entry to lounge even though traveling united-first
3080,United,"@united 2.5 hour delay, misplaced bag, poor communication, and the worse: unsympathetic, confrontational gate agent. Not cool!!!"
3081,United,@united Why don't you respond to my e-mails of facebook msg?! I'm still wating for my tickets!! I'm getting really angry and disappointed!
3082,United,@united then send your Jeff Smisek on a trip with JetBlue or SW and make sure he takes notes. I would never choose to fly United again.
3083,United,@united So disappointed in the service and the level of staff communication. Such a bummer.
3084,United,@United pre-dawn flight to #miami from #EWR. Annual #SOBEWFF trip. Now.

3090,United,"@united to top it all off, your flight attendants talked loudly throug the flight, even when the lights were dimmed. Resulting in no sleep"
3091,United,"@united it seems like no one from United can help me. Lots of fingers pointed, zero people stepping up. At least the gate has Oreos"
3092,United,@united they have access to the dial that makes it faster do they?
3093,United,@united I'll be impressed if I actually get a response! üòú
3094,United,@united hi I left my asus tablet on flight to Heathrow from Newark on 16th feb and wondered how long it takes for someone to check if found?
3095,United,"@united 1hr delay at the start, huge queues at security, no representative to meet us, rude staff at baggage reclaim  #inefficient"
3096,United,@united has the worst flight attendants. They are like those angry and drunk aunts that we all have. Everything has to be an argument.
3097,United,@united its in black and white. EU law and all that ‚Ç¨600 for a Cancelled Flightled flight. I want my money
3098,United,@united accordingly? U dont respond at all

3104,United,@united alright thank you. Much appreciated.
3105,United,@united has happened on other airlines and they've given out flight vouchers and been more transparent about the problems.
3106,United,"@united thanks, I'm booked. Just spent an extra 7 hrs in the TEN w/ no explanation. Now flying middle seat to CHAR instead of Memphis."
3107,United,"@united agent Rick Clifton in SEA-HOU , told him my father is dying and needed to get my handbag on the cabin. he did nothing #shameful"
3108,United,@united Any chance you are allowing reFlight Booking Problems yet for travel out of Denver this weekend due to impending storm?

3118,United,@united I especially like how you upgraded three of your crew members to first class instead of passengers. #keepitclassy #customerservice
3119,United,@united hello. I got off a flight a few months ago and constantly think about your peanuts. Is there anyway you could send me some?
3120,United,@united Flt 359 lax to EWR. Your pilot bragged about getting to EWR early only to wait 20 min for a jetway driver. Thanks United!
3121,United,@united I am so happy I found my phone because this is easily the worst system I have ever heard of
3122,United,Really? 9+hours???? @united: @JenniferWalshPR We don't like delays and do all we can to avoid them. We'll have you on your way ASAP
3123,United,@united @RobBogart After I waited hours in the airport being told one fib after the other. Why can't UAL be honest with its customers?

3131,United,@united you guys are awesome! Thanks!

3133,United,@united I think we both have the same status (nothing). I think there was a bug in your search system.
3134,United,@united Anna Palm Springs gate 19  deserves a medal! Handled 30 ppl missing flights like a pro!
3135,United,@united I would appreciate an answer on why we weren't alerted flight had been Cancelled Flighted until plane landed.  #showsomerespect

3148,United,@united what is your plan to reduce delays?
3149,United,@united I'm searching for flights to redeem with miles and getting different search results with 2 user accounts. Any reason why?
3150,United,"@united rebooked 24 hours after original flight, to say your handling of situation was bad would be an understatement."

3159,United,@united (2/2) pay in person at Portland airport. I will be flying from Perth. This has been done by US Air.
3160,United,"@united she was at the service desk at gate 21, and helped us find a flight to get us to our dest. on time when our flight got Cancelled Flightled"
3161,United,"@united (1/2) thanks, but does not answer my question. I want to make a reservation over the phone in Perth, hold for 24hrs, and have family"
3162,United,@united it wasn't a delay so much as a straight Cancelled Flightlation. Weather wasn't an issue either.
3163,United,@united thanks for ruining my wedding anniversary. Flight UA4904 from EWR to RDU is delayed by over 3 hours and will reach home the nxt day
3164,United,@united Cancelled Flightled my flight for some unknown reason and haven't really given me anything to make my overnight layover tolerable
3165,United,@united the only difference being you are both responsible and in a position to do something about them. Learn from @Delta

3201,United,"@united no, didn't notice I was 38A until start of boarding. Assumed I was 8E. By time boarding started, GAs had cleared standbys, full flt"
3202,United,@united 4840 You knew this flight was delayed! MHT to ALB to EWR to get crew. Your arrival is Late Flightr than the departure! Update your site!
3203,United,@united 4840 WTF! Why can't you update your times in a timely manner? You've known the fight was more delayed! Ur service is awful! @CNN
3204,United,@united Want to book a multi-city fare. Have miles for 1of 2 flights. An option to pay for 1st flight with miles +2nd with UMP Visa? Thanks!
3205,United,@united waiting on plane so long missed my connecting flight it left early. That's the last flight out tonight. HELP http://t.co/hBsJ2sF17h
3206,United,@united ORD Gate C25 and Flt 619-  remember when customers were valuable? Is it so hard to be nice to someone lugging a guitar &amp; carryons ?
3207,United,@united WORST SERVICE EVER. Denied access to our flight and then moved flight 6 times. How hard is it to schedule a gate? @Delta next time.
3208,United,"@united I'm in Denver, my bag is in San Jose. See something wrong here."
3209,United,@united you know it's bad when you're praying your connecting flight is delayed because of an hour delay on the first flight #JustGetMeHome
3210,United,"@united playing hide and seek with the gate. ""We can't find it, it should only be a few more minutes."""
3211,United,"@united so our flight into ORD was delayed because of Air Force One, but the last flight to SBN is at 8:20, 5 mins from now we just landed."
3212,United,@united your flights are really cheap what's the catch
3213,United,@united LGJW7B. I voluntarily rerouted; 1st leg of journey was in economy and was supposed to be 8B. Res agent said she'd reserve it for me
3214,United,@united 5.5hrs Late Flightr and you still can't figure it out. Random text updates. #embarrassing #ua3728 http://t.co/vFTUyJh45X
3215,United,@united stop picking on us #CLE http://t.co/VTqE8m1L3i
3216,United,"@united booked flight in sept to get best price for April to usa, checked now and they are ‚Ç¨67 cheaper, what a con unhappy customer #ripoff"
3217,United,@united too big to properly manage flight times. There is such a thing as being on time. Or at least prepared with a gate when we land!
3218,United,@united I'd rather have the truth about my flight than be forced to sit here all day. Trying to get home to this. http://t.co/U69fAfqhsF
3219,United,@united Leaving soon. Thanks!
3220,United,@united another #DELAYED day. #Delayed outbound. #delayed inbound and now waiting at EWR for a gate to be ready. how is it not ready!??
3221,United,@united Cancelled Flighted my mileage plus award reservation G6455C same day. Have yet to see my miles back despite agent confirmation.
3222,United,@united my partner and I booked individual reservations for same flight. I have Pr. Silver -- can he share my premier privileges somehow?
3223,United,@united 3 Gate changes in 30 minutes for flight to Roanoke and flight to sous falls in O'hare... Painful
3224,United,@united this is nuts they said a flight was on the ground now it's still in Albany and they won't have a plane.  Someone is compensating me
3225,United,"@united Doumented via link. However, now that it has been over four months with no response, what do you suggest? Or shall I not expect one?"
3226,United,@united WHAT?! Y'all have zero concept of customer service. Oh...and now my connection is delayed too!
3227,United,".@united just curious why you'd board a flight without a pilot. Seems crucial to the flight process, no?"
3228,United,@united sent DM's
3229,United,@united just changed again.  This is crazy! #YourAgentsHaveNoClue http://t.co/A37N3oHOKL
3230,United,@united Never can get a flight out on time. 4 hour delay earlier another hour delay on my connecting flight. Makes 10 straight delays
3231,United,@united b/c of your delay now you are oversold by 14 passengers?!??? This is a mess! What are you going to do to compensate?
3232,United,@united - blamed weather lol 78 no wind and not a cloud in the sky!! Delayed both ways 4x!! RU kidding me to charge me for 1.5lb w/8 delays?
3233,United,@united be worse?oh you can't! delayed with no reason on the way to Lon;flight Cancelled Flighted with NO REASON less than 2 days before returning.
3234,United,@united flight 4841...3 gate changes on top of this.  Really hoping you can compensate with some points/mileage to my account!
3235,United,@united should contact me and the others on my flight who can't get their website to work. None of our info is valid! http://t.co/3zpJr7kWbk
3236,United,@united over an hour stuck and still not off the plane. Total failure by you and your partners in ensuring the best customer experience.

3242,United,"@united worst airline ever! Staff is nasty, wifi down bags are delayed due to weather?? And now the belt is broken. Selling UAL stock in AM"

3256,United,@united look at the Twitter history - as usual service non existent
3257,United,@united thanks for the reply. I have been in contact with Customer Care to get clarification on this issue.
3258,United,@united I will give it a couple more weeks. Thank you.
3259,United,@united make sure you make Cancelled Flighted flight baggage and upgrade fees seem like a labyrinth so that you might be able to swindle a few $ more
3260,United,"@united How is this considered ""on time"" if it's arriving at destination half hour Late Flightr than scheduled? http://t.co/YMFTw1uyHr"
3261,United,"@united thanks for trying to take my money without notice. In any other industry, you Cancelled Flight a service, a refund is issued. Cont‚Ä¶"
3262,United,@united And there is no direct phone number for status match desk? I really regret Flight Booking Problems with @united now.
3263,United,@united yet again you disappoint. Sitting at IAD for UA3728 for 3.5hrs and you can't seem to know why the plane hasn't left Albany. #Fail
3264,United,@united still sitting here waiting for a plane....4 hours wasted
3265,United,@united thanks for the help. Wish the phone reps could be so accomidating
3266,United,"@united line is just getting longer and moving slower. Lady working the counter is doing great, she just needs help. #customerservicefail"
3267,United,@united an update on flight 5979 would be great!
3268,United,@united wasting time at baggage claim thanks to your dfw ground crew who checked my bag in without actually checking for space #frustrated
3269,United,@united what is the problem with your flights to ny today
3270,United,@united flight was too heavy so had to fly BACK to Palm Springs (after being in the air for 30 mins)
3271,United,@united Your boarding process sucks. You should learn from @SouthwestAir
3272,United,"@united ouch, delays due to mechanical issues again QRO will have to wait! Yall seem to be falling apart #alwaysdelayed #unitedfail"
3273,United,@united my fingers are crossed that they are more capable of getting baggage from point A-&gt;B than United Airlines!
3274,United,"@united What happened this afternoon? Huge amt of incoming planes to SFO delayed over 1-2 hours.
Frustrating!"
3275,United,@united not about being on my way or impatience on my part...it's about you being untruthful and not having proper systems in place
3276,United,@united can you maybe have more than 1 person working customer service desk in Houston airport? Line 3 rows deep 1 person working
3277,United,"@united I'll stick with my United flight. Thanks, though. Effort is much appreciated."
3278,United,"@united  Your survey is too long.  I fly a lot of segments and I'll fill it out after every trip, but not if it takes more than a minute."
3279,United,@united can you you think about hiring some baggage attendants at EWR? Been waiting for bags for 1 hr. United = overcharged&amp;underserved
3280,United,"@united Fair enough. I don't usually rant, but it's good to know someone's listening. :)"
3281,United,@united are you telling me that you are now Cancelled Flighting my flight ??

3301,United,@united More concerned that you close a club I paid alot for at 10.  Last flight 11:15p.  The construction going on is very inconvenient.
3302,United,@united perfect! Thank you!
3303,United,@united care less about the person - although he walked away while I was complaining.  A man at 10p at LAX club.  More.....
3304,United,@united smiling? NOT!!
3305,United,"@united worst airline in the world-8 delays, gate agent loses her mind over 1.5 lbs and charges me $100 on top of the $25 I already paid!!"

3319,United,@united - I really down think downgrading the booze/food selections at the club is a good way to go.  How about you look @aircanada?

3434,United,@united Over charged me one way for baggage.find out others leaving Pittsburgh with same equipment weren't charged Just hung up on me!!
3435,United,@united #OrthoDoc on-call to in-flight! Glad to have been of service!
3436,United,"@united So publicly you asked for details on my flt. Sent you a DM, like you asked, and have yet (2 days) to hear from you. #unitedfail"
3437,United,@united flight attendant regains karma by giving big sweaty dad cold water. Guy was running &amp; carrying his daughter.  Last one onboard.
3438,United,"@united really hoping to get some help here.  On my 5th attempt to get a resolution, and lost count of transfers.  help please! #mileageplus"

3441,United,@united I just want shout out a thank the pilots and staff on the Feb 13 flight from Newark to Boston at 4:40pm.  They were super helpful!
3442,United,@united can you help from there? UA4935 can't take off without missing galley cart that no one can find. Pax all seated for last hour.
3443,United,"@united For my Grandma Ella's 80th, she would love a birthday greeting from your flight crew! She was a stewardess for Eastern Airlines."
3444,United,"@united is hiring - Flight Dispatcher - Chicago, IL (Network Operations Centerl) https://t.co/lio6oCpTEQ"
3445,United,"@united That doesn‚Äôt make any sense. I‚Äôve been 1K for over 5 years, and you‚Äôre making it harder to keep me loyal."
3446,United,@united have all 747-400s been updated with power outlets and seat-back TVs yet? Flying ORD to Tokyo-Narita on the 28th
3447,United,"@united I need you to get my cousin to PDX, she's on 2 days of travel now and we've had to hire other sitters til she arrives, thx for that"
3448,United,@united Keep the flights cheap and early/on time and you are good. Flew @AmericanAir  and Cancelled Flightled my flight 4 times last month. United&gt;
3449,United,@united the Premier desk was able to rebook me with our friends at @AmericanAir. Only problem is now I have to pay for a checked bag :/
3450,United,"@united I did, and as I thought, nothing happened"
3451,United,@united I'm not booked on a 1:30 return flight..
3452,United,@united the flt TO ORD is correct.  Per my DM- it is the flight from ORD to CVG I was charged for incorrectly
3453,United,"@united You need to change the way customer service is handled! I have been waiting for a supervisor to contact me for 17 days, what gives?"
3454,United,@united I need to talk with an actual person about missing luggage. Please advise on how to make that happen.
3455,United,@united I know I can see that too but now estimated time of dep. is 10am. I don't understand why there wasn't a better estimate 3 hrs ago
3456,United,@united any news?
3457,United,"@united ""where we trick you into making us look popular on Twitter by being the worst airline"" #wellplayed #jokesonus"
3458,United,@united why do I have to request refund? Why charge twice in first place?
3459,United,@united I'll be calling soon but going tomorrow like it shows on the app is not a good option
3460,United,@united I‚Äôve filled out the form twice. No email. I have a lost item code. Can you verify it was received?
3461,United,@united message sent. Thank you!
3462,United,@united that's what I have been told. But refund doesn't really makeup for the inconvenience caused and the missed meeting... Does it?

3474,United,@united followed and messaged. Thanks so much for the help.
3475,United,@united I did not.  That's why I am VERY concerned.
3476,United,@united Please consider letting flyers with no overhead bin items board/deplane first (after first class). Make sense?
3477,United,@united i will never be flying with #UnitedAirlines ever again. $285 for checked bags? All under 50lbs? #angrycustomer #unitedairlinessuck

3528,United,@united the best seats should be for paying customers and we should get to board first #badcustomerservice
3529,United,@united this happens all the time.  United pilots are always in the exit row.  America treats there customers better than their employees.
3530,United,@united yes when I got to the gate I specifically asked if there where any other seats.  Very discouraging to walk past the crew. 37d
3531,United,"@united KOA-LAX should have fresh food service, right?"
3532,United,@united OMG THANK Uüòªüòªüòª
3533,United,@united unavailable leg that registered hours after being sold out. Only option to offer after 45min was +$400/ticket or Travelocity (2of2)

3537,United,"@united  very disappointed by the service starting from gate operator at BOS , who was  rude in stopping a carry-on bag..."
3538,United,@united your service sucks to Mexico from houston. You finally realized that snacks in1st don't work you cheap as);:
3539,United,@united will do. Thank you!
3540,United,"@united Okay, thank you both."
3541,United,"@united they had snacks available, just no fresh food...not sure what happened, but I'm sure we will grab a bite before our SFO connection"
3542,United,"@united if guy on flight 1230 follows through on threat to sue because he couldn‚Äôt carry on 3 bags, I will defend you for free."
3543,United,@united done as requested.
3544,United,@united Pls post video of belligerent jerk ranting at SFO (1230) that's he's going to sue you for making him check his 3rd bag. He's a hoot!
3545,United,@united ^GJ I do believe that this is hands down the worst service I've EVER experienced. Makes @comcast look amazing. #UnitedAirlines
3546,United,@united please give special thanks to Aaron in Tampa office for helping me for literally two hours! He's amazing. Mission accomplished!
3547,United,@united I can't tell/purchase through the website because they put us on a Lufthansa flight for the first leg.

3559,United,@united did I win :)

3570,United,"@united we finally just arrive to Bogota, good but long flight!!"
3571,United,@united it's not there we tried. It's already here in cancun just no one has delivered it
3572,United,"@united what you did was illegal and a breach of contract. I will be in touch but not through your ""customer feedback"""
3573,United,@united its not the way to treat your customers we had a lot of issues and it was not worth our headache we went thru
3574,United,@united yes we are in EWR and it was corrected but just the fact the it was beought up for us to share rooms is unexpactable
3575,United,@united Want to make my day? :) Friend is Premier &amp; I should be soon. Any chance you can upgrade our two 10 hr leg of flights to ecom plus?
3576,United,@united please review and fix your baggage procedures at Dulles because it happens every week when my sister travels there on your airline
3577,United,@united nothing else from you ^GJ? Where is your customer service?
3578,United,@united that's of course in lax
3579,United,@united ok thanks! Where are you counters located? And how Late Flight are they open?

3585,United,@United I'm pretty sure I've got shin splits from SPRINTING through IAH only to watch my plane pull away from the jet way...
3586,United,@united well the income flight to dca to take us to ewr was delayed and it made us miss our connection to FLL so yes hotels were necessary
3587,United,@united can you please stop Cancelled Flightling your flights? I am trying to get home to take two exams tomorrow. You've Cancelled Flightled 3 flights on me.
3588,United,@united &amp; I've been hung up on twice by your staff. So upset right now

3590,United,"@united 2 hour flight from FLL to Ewr, 1242, now waiting 1 hour plus for bags, no sign yet. What gives????"

3598,United,"@united you can't claim ""weather"" with your hardworking crew pulling seats out of a plane! Do the right thing. But we both know you won't"
3599,United,"@united you're missin the point! There was no ""weather"". You're lying! Seats was broken. But u claim ""weather"" to get out of hotels. Classy"
3600,United,@united are you trying to break a world record for most delayed flights in a year?
3601,United,@united I have flights that don't appear to have been applied to my MileagePlus account. Can you help?
3602,United,"@united @VUSA_Australia I'm just an Aussie cowgirl lookin' for my cowboy. Take me to Fort Worth, Estelle says I'll find him there!"
3603,United,"@united Okay, thank you for your help :)"

3664,United,"@united It was quite enjoyable. üòä 

Except now he's stuck on the runway in Houston. üòï"
3665,United,@united thank you for getting our daughter home when @americanair Cancelled Flightled all their flights to Nashville
3666,United,"@united thanks for the re-upgrade to 1st class. It may be a 45 min flight, but it is appreciated."
3667,United,"@united makes total sense, except flight wasn't full :) I've got empty seats around me &amp; overheads were more than half open when I boarded."
3668,United,"‚Äú@united: @ItsAaronChriz Sorry to hear about your flight. Do you need help reFlight Booking Problems?‚Äù

üëé"
3669,United,@united now we are trying to get to San Juan from Chicago O'Hare. Having lots of problems. May get a standby flight.
3670,United,"@united Alright, thank you. Is there a page that says the routes you have for each aircraft? Specifically the 787."
3671,United,"@united well sorta....we r trying to get to Aquadilla, PR but only 1 flight goes there a day. All are booked. UA Cancelled Flighted our flight to NJ"
3672,United,@united why does it cost $547 to change the city of origin when the same flight on http://t.co/8FMZZOltv9 costs $165 #customerservicefail
3673,United,@united I just sent a long note with some suggestions. Thanks for getting back to me.
3674,United,@united there are at least 3 of us on UA1564 at ORD waiting to deplane to catch UA4232 to CLT. Any chance of waiting to last second for us?
3675,United,@united @parryaftab done thnx
3676,United,"@united, I'm still frustrated I gave up my seat &amp; the promised Travel Certificate was withheld w/o explanation. http://t.co/KvfwajVViD"
3677,United,"@united gotta love giving up 1st class upgrade b/c flight delayed, to get another flight (also delayed) just to ensure I make my connection."
3678,United,@united PTY to PIT via IAH
3679,United,"@united Not sure what happened @ MSP yesterday, but VERY UNHAPPY my bag was not only delayed, but sat at MSP for 8 hrs b4 delivery @ 2:30 am"
3680,United,@united Is it possible to redeem miles for one part of a round trip itinerary without having to book two separate reservations?
3681,United,@united I'm flying @AmericanAir on the way back. I rarely fly them but let's see if they are any better....
3682,United,@united sent
3683,United,@united it's almost like we're punished for living near a large metro area. EWR was top ranked for domestic delays. Not good
3684,United,"@united Honestly, I stopped trying to report things via website. Now I just laugh. Flights work. Miles accrue. I'm sure it's just cosmetic."
3685,United,"@united thanks. Weather is understandable, but when every single domestic flight is delayed because of inbound int'l flights, it's crazy"
3686,United,"@united #1007 Houston-Bogota boarding again, safety first, it seems the mechanics fixed the problem faster, good energy to fly home/family"
3687,United,@united no tag number. Luggage was taken off the weigh scale and appears to have been sent off on conveyor belt without any tag...
3688,United,@united have reported it.  Still in Istanbul at the moment apparently.  On the other plane haha.  Hats off to the pilot!
3689,United,"@united, Understandable. I did try Flight Booking Problems several times for 2 passengers &amp; got the messages I mentioned before. As for the agents price???"
3690,United,"@united hey awesome!  Thanks for the reply, will be filling the form out! @AmericanAir"
3691,United,@united flying tomorrow from mexico to US. Mileage tkts dont show 1k status. Help
3692,United,@united correct date is 2/11/15!
3693,United,@united 3 phone reps. None could see I was rebooked so missed that flight.Told to go standby for a nonexistent Late Flightr flight. Did I hurt you?
3694,United,@united a report was filed with the airport police on 11th and 12th February-I have the police case number if required
3695,United,"@united can't DM, you're not following. LLY144. Rebooked on #UA1516 but still need seats."
3696,United,@united the supervisor on situation- Stacey took all our details-no claim number given to us
3697,United,@united 1 hour since boarding began and we're still sitting at the gate.  #UA507
3698,United,@united Tks for reply. PSP employees blamed Late Flight departure on POTUS when main reasons were DVR flt Late Flight &amp; insufficient ground crew to handle
3699,United,@united took this one just for you. Not a window. Also not fun if you get motion sick. http://t.co/m81rV0blxs
3700,United,"@united they are all -pilots, FA and ground personnel doing a great job. Weather is to blame... Who do I talk to about that :)"
3701,United,"@united I find this text funny, considering we are still sitting here because 2 seats need to be changed out. http://t.co/LoLuWfCi11"
3702,United,"@united #1007 Houston-Bogota with an engine problem, mechanics trying to ""fix"" the problem, safety first, better to change the plane"
3703,United,@united thanks! Makes sense. Just annoying that it can't be determined better.
3704,United,@united patiently drinking and tweeting about my experience
3705,United,@united you have yourselves to blame for giving me the time to get drunk and tell you how I feel about your overpriced sub par airline
3706,United,@united idea: if u don't want us to be frustrated don't Cancelled Flight flights because your crew overflowed a toilet. Get a plumber
3707,United,@united I will be patient in my luxurious middle seat on my next delayed flight
3708,United,@united I will be patient as your agent explains how you have me booked on a new flight for 6:18 when that plane doesn't arrive until 6:07
3709,United,@united please help trace my luggage which was put through without a name tag on 11 February 2014 at Albuquerque airport
3710,United,@united be patient while I let this string of tweets go out showing people you are bad at your business
3711,United,@united I think you guys had a half full flight at 4 so you held our overbooked 3pm flight to fill the other one then Cancelled Flightled mine
3712,United,"@united's in-flight promo on their TV's includes Brian Williams. Tough to edit that quickly. Not a complaint, just an observation."
3713,United,@united thanks I'll fill out the form that no one reads or responds to.
3714,United,@united I was patient when they refused to switch my flight Bc of my checked bag then Cancelled Flightled the one I was on

3717,United,@united I wrote to you but got nothing.and I am out of US .It is very simple thing.Will ypu provide compensation for your delay?
3718,United,@united How many 787s do you currently operate and what other aircraft do you operate?
3719,United,"‚Äú@united: @qlyss8 We don't want our customers to be frustrated. Thank you for your patience. ^JT‚Äù A lovely sentiment, but not a $180 one."
3720,United,@united 4 different departure / arrival updates for UA304??? In 1hr. Please!
3721,United,@united nope. Really. No window at all for 10A. 10F has one. 8 and 11 has one. None for 10A. So sad...
3722,United,"@united #vegan meals can be more creative than noodles, peas, and zukes. Non-vegan yogurt is not acceptable for a vegan. Can you do better?"
3723,United,"@united well, thanks for not charging me for switching my two Cancelled Flightled flights anyway. That was pretty nice. #stillmakingmepoorthough"
3724,United,@united well it IS John Hughes' birthday. But I will stick w the plane &amp; hold off on trains &amp; automobiles. Gate workers are doing well.
3725,United,@united - my son left his tablet on plane.  Am out of country and can not call easily.  Is there an email to contact?
3726,United,"I will, if you can show me where this new program is beneficial to your longstanding loyal consumers... @united"
3727,United,@united all i hear is blah blah blah ....you shoulda used that $400 to buy a @burningman ticket instead. &amp; ill be driving there not flying
3728,United,"@united yes, supposed to be here by 6PM. I have a Board Meeting tomorrow. Fingers crossed."
3729,United,@united thanks for not letting me switch flights Bc I had a checked bag then Cancelled Flighting my flight forcing me to take another 3 hrs Late Flightr!
3730,United,@united thank you! Love united!! Have 4 flights today!
3731,United,"@united Just did, thanks for checking! :)"
3732,United,@united just informed you don't reimburse for issues due to weather. this is why your flights keep getting Cancelled Flightled--Thor hates you
3733,United,"@united Midland couldn't get our bags to connect on our Intl flight to Sydney, so have to get em in LA &amp; check em in there."
3734,United,@united this may be the last time I fly your airline.
3735,United,"@united Is your company motto: ""I do not care!!!""  I heard several times from your employees to your clients in the past week.""  #idonotcare"
3736,United,@united you should tell that to the staff at LAX then. I boarded group 5 at the very end of the queue as a Gold member. Thanks for nothing.
3737,United,"@united Missing crew, passenger doc problems, frozen toilets, and now we're off the plane. Give me my money back.  UA3466"
3738,United,@united Fantastic job by your people today on ua22 from Dublin. A jam packed plane but the crew was wonderful!!
3739,United,"@united there was 20 min to departure, no one waiting. On being pressed ground staffer threatened ""do you want to get to SF today"" #fail"
3740,United,@united flying lax to Sfo and system won't let me check in. Your site tells me to do it through @AirCanada and they tell me through you.
3741,United,"@united and btw, the @Virgin and @JetBlue managed on time departures same time same destination- &amp; wouldn't take away a 9year old kids bag!"
3742,United,@united can I just go ahead and live in your premium cabins? I'm in heaven now en route to LHR
3743,United,"@united feeling poor on the church-mouse level here, 180 dollars is enough to make a grown man cry. I'm not a grown man but tears happened"
3744,United,@united sure but the plane is an hour Late Flight! Your ontime departure ship sailed away a long time back!
3745,United,@united UA6002 MLI-&gt;DEN. Will miss connection UA3530 DEN-&gt;YEG due to delay.
3746,United,"@united How come you are the ONLY airline, of 90+ flights last year that makes me check my carry-on. Not even gate check...baggage claim?!?"
3747,United,@united I had to change airports to actually get a flight out when my flight from FAY was Cancelled Flightled twice. $180 taxi ride to RDU--reimburse?
3748,United,@united it's operated by united as it's a heathrow-Newark flight
3749,United,@united yes of course I have.  Is this how you treat customer with no recourse?
3750,United,@united I will be stunned if my bags are in Hartford with me.  The ORD ground crew only had an hour to move my bags 200 yards
3751,United,"@united Can someone assist me with my DM's? Waiting 1 hour on phone, 2 hours on Twitter."
3752,United,"@united Flight was overbooked! Was offered voucher to wait &amp; take another flight. Gate agent switched me over, retracted voucher offer."
3753,United,@united thank you!
3754,United,@united Thanks - it's very helpful to understand that the reduced price seats that are sold at check-in have priority over the certificates.
3755,United,@united As a Million Miler I've been delayed plenty. NEVER in the amateurish way@SilverAirwsys does it. I'd be embarrassed to be affiliated.
3756,United,"@united airlines claims to have a low fare guarantee, but they won't honor a lower fare that I found."
3757,United,@united Another delayed United flight. I should not be this surprised or upset. I'm mostly disappointed I have to Cancelled Flight my trip with my dad
3758,United,"@united still can't dm, it's LH7631 on 21/2/15"
3759,United,@united Thank you Margo at Houston's Bush Intercontinental for getting me home earlier.
3760,United,"@united, I booked our flights w/ @WestJet. I saw the same prices each time I searched. It wasn't the least bit frustrating. #customerservice"
3761,United,"@united, Thanks, but I didn't want to see 'we've started your flight search over' OR 'the fare &amp; rules for this itinerary has changed' again"
3762,United,@united my cats flight was delayed 1+hour  she will be arriving to Hawaii after 5 &amp; I won't be able to pick her up until tomorrow üò≠
3763,United,"@united I did not, my mind was on getting to the next flight."
3764,United,@united now you've lost my bags too.  At least nobody has done anything to help out.  This is absurd.
3765,United,@united What's up with the reduction in E+ on 737-900s? 1K who can no longer confirm E+.  Forget upgrades - just want legroom. #unitedfail
3766,United,@united offered me a voucher to switch flights. Now voucher offer doesn‚Äôt exist &amp; the gate agent switched me to a delayed flight!
3767,United,@united when southwest did this to us -- a mechanical problem at least they gave us round trip vouchers. Will you step up to the pLate Flight too?
3768,United,@united I usually like flying with you guys but $200 fee to use my credit seems ridiculous #notcool #exhorbitantfees
3769,United,"@united Thanks, but not so much the missing bag as the nonexistent staff at this apparent remote outpost (busy airport for city of ~1M)."
3770,United,@united my friend lost luggage on flight 1547. What to do?
3771,United,"@united sweet, follow back and I'll get the dm off"
3772,United,@united my reservation were changed so that I can longer make my connecting flight. How can I change this without incurring a fee?
3773,United,@united all good! Next flight was a little delayed so it all worked üëç
3774,United,@united flight 5431
3775,United,"@united Just boarded UA1297, was refused from carrying overhead bag as no space, in plane now with loads of space #fail #customerexperience"
3776,United,@united get your act right! You just lost customers because your staff wouldn't let us take our approved carry-on on a half empty flight!
3777,United,@united @ShulemStern @gg8929 Raise a dispute with your cc provider and they will hopefully clear it for you.
3778,United,@united Held up for almost 45 minutes and then promised free movies and it didn't work and neither did the wifi that was paid for. Boo :(
3779,United,"@united Nice ""partners"" you have. The delays keep increasing every 20 min @FtLauderdaleSun @orlandosentinel http://t.co/1AtEafnC6R"
3780,United,@united UA1740 just admit you have no clue when flight will leave Denver. #unfriendlyskies
3781,United,"@united yep, after long waiting on the phone we managed to rebook it. Hope it will be a pleasent one. Thanks for ur help."
3782,United,@united Just had the worst experience ever flying with you
3783,United,@United UA1740. As the inbound flight dep time gets closer you push it back 15 min. You've been doing this for 2 hrs.
3784,United,@united why is my flight from mke to ord getting delayed? Our gate attendant is not communicating!
3785,United,"@united my plane sounds like  a DJ  scratching is this normal? If so, will this eventually be a new entertainment fee."
3786,United,@united chase says no referral bonus. Thanks.
3787,United,"@united how can i trust United with future Flight Booking Problemss when a confirmed, ticketed and purchased ticket is Cancelled Flightled after the fact?"
3788,United,@united rebooked.  This one is Late Flight too.
3789,United,@united 2nd Late Flight flight today
3790,United,"@united if u miss first leg of ur flight, you have to pay hundreds of $'s just to keep your second leg? How much to keep my earned miles?"
3791,United,"@united 3586 from IAD to BUF.  Incredibly loud, and like a third world 70s inner city metro bus.  #lowstandards http://t.co/m67WnBglXQ"

3795,United,@united I am blown away by stellar #custserv !! Thank you &lt;3 http://t.co/JOrEScfb4x
3796,United,@united your overall experience of flying is not friendly
3797,United,@united a good start would be  to warm the plane before the departure time so the flight isn't delayed due to frozen water lines.
3798,United,@united annnnddddd I'm going to lose my first class seat on the flight they shuffle me to
3799,United,@united you have the nicest gate attendant at Newark airport gate 101 right now. Multiple delays and she is still pleasant with everyone.
3800,United,@united 6 hour mechanical delay...killing me
3801,United,@united every time I check a bag with your airline I'm confident I will be wearing the same clothes for 3 days.  Please prove me wrong.

3805,United,@united please help! Left my iPad Air 2 on my flight from NYC to Paris yesterday and can‚Äôt get in touch with anyone locally. What to do?
3806,United,@united When will that happen? It really confuses when the 1st content to come on the 6in screens is about how technology forward United is.
3807,United,"@united you mean like my mailing address and rate? By the surliness of my United ""coworkers"" I'm guessing our benefits aren't great."
3808,United,@united I already sent feedback and your reps are who told me about the priority. I'm speechless at your system
3809,United,@united just because you are a monopoly in @flySFO doesn't mean you treat your frequent fliers like crap.
3810,United,"@united Yeah, bag is on the way. As per usual.  I'm actually getting used to getting it delivered to me, its kind of nice in a sense."
3811,United,@united How much is baggage check for International flights?

3814,United,@united LE2V9D pnr numbered flight. The first leg is Cancelled Flightled due to bad weather in iatanbul. How can i make a reFlight Booking Problems
3815,United,"@united (2/2) It suggests that if can't confirm cert at time of Flight Booking Problems, I should assume that it may never clear. Didn't used to be that way"
3816,United,"@united Thanks for explanation. It seems like an odd incentive structure, tho, because it dramatically diminishes the value of the certs."
3817,United,@united #sfo #ClearVision #TV4U @ United Terminal SFO Airport http://t.co/Q9bYn9pCTf
3818,United,"2/2 @united You don't really care about our comfort, you care about profitability. That's fine, just own up to it. #unfriendlyskies"
3819,United,1/2 @united Just be honest with your customers. The new seats are designed to fit more rows on the plane. More rows = more money.
3820,United,@united missing this wedding because of these delays would not be cool
3821,United,@united Designed to deter people from forgetting things or to provide more storage space? The article says the latter #unfriendlyskies
3822,United,"@united what do you think missing meetings is worth?  A flight voucher?  I fly all the time, so what would make it right?"
3823,United,"@United and @DirectTV. Not to pile on, but it's time to update your in flight TV package. http://t.co/Lug4MFVWsA"
3824,United,@united  why is it so hard to add in meal preferences AFTER I booked tickets? I forgot to do it &amp; it's now impossible! I even called.
3825,United,@united it's amazing really.
3826,United,@united Learn to hold connections. They texted me there is another flight Late Flightr - my connection hasn't left and were pulling into the gate
3827,United,@united if I have credit from a flight I Cancelled Flightled does the new flt have to be booked by 1 yr from orig purchase date or flown by that date?

3831,United,@united a plane took our gate and now we're just waiting in a lot at DIA

3879,United,@united I submitted a status match last week and have not heard back. Im a delta customer looking to switch to United. Please assist.
3880,United,@united 1627 to Montego Bay going back to gate bc 1person was Late Flight? Awful service for all of who came on time!!
3881,United,@united right... Are you guys charging for the air we breathe next?

3883,United,"@united in other words... sorry, not sorry.  Plenty of other airlines... and I travel A LOT."
3884,United,@united delayed agAin by United. Gate agent was borderline rude when I asked her a flight status question. What is happening to United?
3885,United,@united I need to speak with a supervisor or someone who is #willing to help me use a credit I have ASAP.  #letsworktogether
3886,United,"@united just give up.  Your service is terrible.  If I wasn't forced to use United on certain routes, I never would."
3887,United,@united Club in Denver is dope üëå
3888,United,"@united I'm checked in, agent wouldn't tag my bags at 7am. Now I'm standing in line hell."
3889,United,@united we are never going to get to out gate at this rate.
3890,United,@united this is getting ridiculous. Now we're missing our connection.
3891,United,@united Couldn't use the confirmed upgd cert you gave me b/c you decided to sell anyone a biz seat for $299. Why do you bother giving them?
3892,United,@united I locked myself out of my account and needed access to book a flight.
3893,United,@united @annricord January 15th.
3894,United,@united any chance you can troubleshoot check ins at @FlyYOW ? We're at 20 minutes per person.
3895,United,@united how on earth could you close the united club in Atlanta? What a major #fail at an airport of this size
3896,United,@united sorry to hear outsourcing plan. Boise is best staff/cust service in the country. #boise
3897,United,@united -LGA-ORD UA 711. Did not get agent name. Argument over baggage policy.
3898,United,@united yes staff were rude  and unempathetic. I needed jacket and tablet by 4 got at 11. If u take carryons cause plane full.don't lose em!
3899,United,@united Monday evening.
3900,United,"@united is pri boarding for ""Active Military"" or only ""In Uniform?"" 90% can't travel in uniform for OPSEC reason, even on official travel"
3901,United,@united leisure. Military personnel for safety reason R highly recommended to not travel in uniform
3902,United,@United ticket counter Masters out of SMF not very helpful.
3903,United,"@united cool, thanks."
3904,United,@united my baggage is in shannon now so never mind u can work on giving me some $$$ back now
3905,United,"@united if you're listening, why are you the lowest provider of inflight wifi? Get with the times!"
3906,United,@united that's funny because I emailed @VirginAtlantic once and they found it hadn't left LHR. In the mean time stuck with no bag in NYC!!!
3907,United,"@united is the biggest joke of a company,I will never fly with them again! 3 days now waiting for my bag, they don't even know where it is!"
3908,United,@united why haven't you updated that flight 4411 is delayed? Super frustrating
3909,United,@united How long can I expect the formal response to take?
3910,United,"@united Hi, I am flying domestic first from SEA to HNL. Can I pay to use the lounge before I fly or this is just for international? Thanks"
3911,United,"@united Do you mean ""fortunately""? I don't want my flight to be affected! üòâ"
3912,United,"@united volumes, profit up http://t.co/pKfI9bTtzf #aviation #aircargo http://t.co/BBj6kMTYUl"
3913,United,"@United what the...? I go into the ""all airlines lounge"" w/ my Star Alliance Club Card in BCN only to be told Star Alliance isn't accepted"
3914,United,@united Y do U not reply to customer refund forms??????????? #unitedairlines
3915,United,@united &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;------- shoddy customer service. Of no use whatsoever. #unitedairline
3916,United,@united &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;-------- do not reply to emails?
3917,United,"@united it has now been 16 days since i applied for my compensation?

Y have i had no correspondence"
3918,United,@united it sucks not having the money to book a flight to see the love of my life. 2600 miles away.
3919,United,@united submitted customer care form Jan 7th. Still no response. A little longer then 7 - 10 business days
3920,United,"@united @laurasbrown5 Clearly United lives in the stone age. Some people don't need computers, make your site better for tablets and phones"
3921,United,"@united @laurasbrown5 What does ""dealing via email"" have anything to do with a crappy web form that is not made for mobile devices"
3922,United,"@united speaking of my flight, skateboards are allowed as carry on bagage right? No extra payment needed?"
3923,United,"@united @PGATOUR @NTrustOpen Next thing you know, United will believe they are above the DOT and take them to court. United is anti-consumer"
3924,United,@united @PGATOUR @NTrustOpen I read that last hashtag as Go F United. Makes sense since they F us by Cancelled Flightling ticketed reservations
3925,United,@united The link in the message I was replying to. #3thparty #ITproblems
3926,United,"@united Hi, I read there are weather warnings on the East Coast of the US. Would a flight from LHR to SFO be affected?"
3927,United,@united You delayed a connection for customer service today now I'll be able to pay my final respects to a dear family member. Thank you :)
3928,United,@united am I allowed to bring a duffle bag and back pack as my carry on and personal item? Flying out of NY
3929,United,@united @gg8929 I'm sorry United isn't able to keep its word 'cuz their IT is totally inadequate but they still says it's a customer fault!
3930,United,@united How can you not know where my bags are?  You knew where they were 6 hours ago. You are killing me!  Worst service. Ever.
3931,United,@united Stop pretending you care about the welfare of my daughter. United Airlines had the opportunity to help n failed # United airlines
3932,United,@united I have received one previously on the 11th having checked. Odd as you said there was no complaint associated with my e-mail?
3933,United,"@united ok, I have that, pretty sure I had it before too but will wait and see what happens...."
3934,United,@united Checking tracing information. You got 2 numbers wrong in my phone number &amp; how did a turquoise duffle bag become a black laptop bag?
3935,United,@united  treats service members like crap never flying again with them #UnitedAirlines  @CNN
3936,United,"@united Thanks. UA1121, DEN, 40 min on tarmac."
3937,United,@united What is the point of a UPC code on checked baggage if you can't tell me where my luggage is? Vacation- day 3: trying on swimsuits...
3938,United,@united why are your SFO-&gt;BOS nonstop flights not competitively priced with those of JetBlue and Virgin? $179 vs $324. Identical times.
3939,United,@united how come I have no baggage updates.
3940,United,"@united Thanks for your response. Bags came, but it was a long wait and priority tags weren't honored at all. Disappointing"
3941,United,@United @UnitedAirlines and the hits keep on coming. http://t.co/44ZHmfDIW6 #unitedfail #unitedwithivy
3942,United,"@united hi JH. Yes please. Since I lost almost a whole day on the way out, could you help me change my return for one day Late Flightr?"
3943,United,"@united 3 hrs searching for flts, find 1 on site &amp; can't book the $ offered bc 1 seg isn't really available. #lies #falseadvertising"
3944,United,@united next flight? Don't think I'll be spending anymore money with you guys ever. It was that bad.
3945,United,@united are my bags here yet?  They were at Palm Springs airport.  I was at LAX.  How come I beat my bags here.
3946,United,@united why couldn't you have changed the tire of my delayed UA1127 flight when it arrived instead of waiting until boarding?
3947,United,@united A generic form with tons of fields asking for info you already?  Expected more as a premier platinum. Another #servicefail
3948,United,"@united, wtf is your username and/or email addr signin STILL unavailable? Been trying to login since Sunday"
3949,United,"@united I am flying from msp to dxb, my child will turn 2 during the trip do I have to buy a return ticket for my child?"
3950,United,@united I want my bags. There is vital equipment in there. You are royally screwing me. I'm cranky and want an update.
3951,United,@united you guys have such big hearts.. keep up the good work
3952,United,@united Flight 512 had sime of the rudest flight attendants. I was run over by the drink card and had a flashlight dropped on me. #noapology
3953,United,"@united I am VERY disappointed with @SilverAirways as your partner. No communication, 2 extremely Late Flight flights. Really, all around horrible."
3954,United,"@united unless it's on you guys, im good."
3955,United,@united are the miles going to be restructured? Help a silver status brotha out! I thought I was winning with you guys until today lol
3956,United,"@united even with the multiplier the ticket price will still never equal the amount of miles you travel, even for transatlantic flights!"
3957,United,"@united missed connection, wrong city, bags at Palm Springs, but not at hotel. I am seriously tired of being treated this way."
3958,United,@united Where are my bags!!!  They weren't in LAX like your promised.  9 out of 10 things today were a mess today because of you.
3959,United,@united dang... I thought I was in a teleportation device! Ua514
3960,United,@united received my bag. I appreciate taking care of the matter and following up!
3961,United,@united still haven't received a response. Please direct message me for my contact information.
3962,United,@united I've been waiting on my bag in IAH for 45mins.  They're only 4 freaking people on that flight waiting for bags.  Fix this!!
3963,United,@united so if this game was the one reason I payed for @DIRECTV is there something we could work out here? http://t.co/HQDTK6aTue
3964,United,@united :take note of this great example of @JetBlue actually making good for an extremely inconvenient situation. http://t.co/t3Gnk2N7LD
3965,United,@united RTB&gt;IAH 2/17 First class. My wife (Global Services) and I had headaches due to our neighbors smoking e cigarettes. Contact me pls
3966,United,"@united ""federal regulation prohibits you being separated from your bag""...yet you lose our bag and that's okay"
3967,United,@united tried to check it 40 mins before a flight rather than 45 mins and we are stonewalled by your employees...
3968,United,@united Hello. Just wondering how long it might take for Turkish Airlines flights to show up in my United miles. Thanks.
3969,United,@united do you guys have any working planes?
3970,United,@united we just almost had a major accident on ua3710 ... How about passing on some information to those of us waiting on plane!!!
3971,United,"@united again, you said to go take the time to go there, knowing what the issue was, and knowing you won‚Äôt fix it."
3972,United,@united 3 hour delay plus a jetway that won't move. This biz traveler is never flying u again!
3973,United,@united my son is a passenger on flight 3710 from Chicago to Toronto. The plane came within feet of colliding  another plane and is stopped.
3974,United,"@united That made me so mad, but then I called the bag number, and that person was helpful and told me where the bag really was. (2/2)"
3975,United,"@united Yes. It was the airport person who told me the bag was still in Nashville, when I filed the claim. (1/2)"
3976,United,@united The only thing you fella have done right today is get me to the pacific time zone.
3977,United,@united Ugh.  My bags were sent to Palm Springs and not to LAX as promised.  They better be at the hotel when I get there.
3978,United,"@united Direct Messaged you, didn't hear anything back"
3979,United,"@united yup, it just happens way too often...5 times in the last 12 months"
3980,United,"@united Great, thank you!! I'll send it now."
3981,United,@united so who does handle bag issues? And why wouldn't you put me onto them in the first place?
3982,United,@united big up the pilot of 644 for turning 1hr on the tarmac to just a 20min delayed arrival
3983,United,@united returned from vacation + went to luggage services. Golf bag was presented in clear wrap that could've been used in the first place.
3984,United,@united Holiday of a lifetime to New York ruined because you lost my luggage and have failed to find it since Sunday! #wontflyagainwithyou
3985,United,@united my golf bag didn't have a top cover + staffers said they couldn't check without a type of cover or wrap. Forced to leave the bag...
3986,United,@united when will you offer real food in american clubs like the amazing food you offer in Heathrow?
3987,United,@united once again my bag is lost when I travel united!!!! Please do something
3988,United,@united @annricord both!
3989,United,@united Stuck on plane for over an hour due to mechanical faults. Any updates please? This happened on way to Newark and now again to LHR...
3990,United,@united - flight 1114. Unfortunately this isn't an isoLate Flightd incident. I haven't waited less than 20min in years
3991,United,@united did I mention one bag is an infant car seat &amp; we've been stuck with yr poor replacement on icy mtn roads
3992,United,"@united this is in ur Hemispheres magazine. I'm open to what will u do to make the ""flight more pleasant."" http://t.co/VrQDpqEPFW"
3993,United,@united hard to believe since your staff @ SFO checked them under someone by the name of #ritacomo who flew to EWR the same day.
3994,United,"@united it's Late Flight... I'm tired and understandably edgy for trying to catch my flight. I wasn't chipper, but I def was not rude."
3995,United,"@united rude cust ser agents busy chatting, then yelled bc I took pic. Put me stdby when seat. Diff agent gave me seat 30min Late Flightr. Platinum"
3996,United,"@united I am a frequent user. Congrats u only lost my bags once in 20 years. Problem, it was today and your staff were rude!üò¢ still no bag!"
3997,United,@united Sivi Stewart at Lax was fantastic tonight helping to find a lost item for us at the airport.  Much thanks!
3998,United,"@united Yes, though they have not located the bag yet. It was a lovely flight outside of that."
3999,United,@united Got me home amid snow &amp; Cancelled Flightlations; delivered bag w/o hassle; plus no wait on phone &amp; an upgrade. Thank you!
4000,United,"@united My wife has been on the phone several times for past 3 days, with no result."
4001,United,@united so you are saying that customer care does not report to anyone? Their response is humiliating for a company that serves the public.
4002,United,"@united #unitedairlines so my feedback is for your benefit, not for you to correct your atrocious customer service? Good to know"
4003,United,@united #UnitedAirlines fill out form and never receive response? I expect remedy. We can travel another airline and Cancelled Flight as members w u.
4004,United,"@united 12/13EWR-LAX UA1151 my seat/armrest broken discover after takeoff. flight full.FA filed report, who to chat with for partial refund?"
4005,United,"@united so you told me to go, knowing what the issue was, only for me to go there and find out that you won‚Äôt fix it?"
4006,United,"@united so, I made it all the way to the airport, and they say they won‚Äôt fix the handle. I showed you this problem, and you said to go‚Ä¶?"
4007,United,@united This link in your tweet goes to someone's internal email -&gt; http://t.co/ZksX79itdN...... Probably one of your 3rd party IT contracts
4008,United,@united then why do you bother responding? Your customer service is THE WORST. Never using you guys again.
4009,United,@united 618 was flight out of Houston
4010,United,@united free hotel doesn't make up for such poor customer service and disregard
4011,United,@united it's messed up to refuse to wait 10 min after united is at fault for delay but to leave early is absolutely disgusting.
4012,United,@united mechanical delay occurred in Houston earlier today re: their flight to ORD
4013,United,"@united 374 ORD to ROC. Fam came to see me at SNA. I'm a member, so is my dad. He used his miles for them."
4014,United,"Cc @DadBoner  #boldflavors ‚Äú@united: We‚Äôre bringing Bourbon St. to 35,000 ft. with bold flavors, fresh ingredients and more dining options"""
4015,United,@united thx for checking in. Never got through via phone. On hold over hour. How long is too long to wait on hold? Ugh. #csfail
4016,United,@united is there a referral program for the Milageplus explorer card?
4017,United,@united how else would I know it was denied?
4018,United,@united obviously
4019,United,"@united You allow shady 3rd party services to sell your tickets and then refuse to help the customer, who's left holding the bag.
#flyunited"
4020,United,@united Hours on the phone...hung up on...all I want is to be on a different flight (same day) that has an open seat. #greatservice
4021,United,@united which now has maintenance issues with an undetermined amount of time until the mechanics even arrive
4022,United,@united I sent an email describing my experience. Looking forward to a follow up to hopefully make it right.

4026,United,@united our flight attendant @superben was super helpful in finding a bag we left on a flight today. Excellent customer service. Name fits.
4027,United,@united how about changing RNO -DEN non-stop In May (9) from 6am to Late Flight morning or early afternoon?
4028,United,@united #UnitedAirlines wont wait 10min for fam w 2yr old connecting. flight leaves early instead for airport that is planes last stop today
4029,United,"@united I can‚Äôt go back to the airport, I‚Äôm working, and won‚Äôt have time.  Are you telling me there is seriously no other way?"
4030,United,@united instead of Bourbon street how about #quiet #planes #SaveTheDiagonals
4031,United,@united 3875 to Denver which we are supposed to be boarding right now but has yet to land
4032,United,@united I've been doing this for 15 years and I've never had this many issues with any other airline.
4033,United,@united haha that's fine. Still won't fly @united ever again. Seems like you guys have more problems than anyone else.
4034,United,@united note: they are traveling w 2yr old. Unreal
4035,United,@united and that plane was staying overnight at the next airport - ROC. U can make up 10 min in air but instead of waiting u leave EARLY
4036,United,@united and they were traveling as guests of a mileage plus member using that members miles. Great customer service.
4037,United,@united mechanical issues causes delay and connecting plane at ORD only needed to wait 10 min for them. Refused and left early instead. Wtf
4038,United,"@united captain ""we apologize for the delay, the company is looking for an open gate (glance starboard side, see 5 open gates)"
4039,United,@united reinstating the kosher meals that were dropped shortly after the merger?
4040,United,"@united I'm on one of your 757-300 between JFK and LAX.When r u upgrading planes?Plane has no Screens,lousy seats And that's in UnitedFirst."
4041,United,@United is it possible to upfare to P a segment where I have a GPU waitlisted?
4042,United,"@United Bringing your ""A"" game with premium cabin dining. Nice! https://t.co/zgOQoxjBQY"
4043,United,@united you already have vomit so you are halfway there
4044,United,@united is amazing how hard is to talk with customer service! !!
4045,United,"@united fair enough, but it stinks to be the passenger on the plane that leaves the gate then sits on the tarmac for an hour before takeoff"
4046,United,@united they held the flight for our group of nearly 20 people.
4047,United,@united you guys suck. You delay flights but can't hold the connectors 10 minutes??? #WorstAirlineEver
4048,United,@united I Want a Plane dad
4049,United,"@united time for a rant...you delayed my flight and still forgot my luggage...then delayed on the Tarmac, moments I love you United"
4050,United,"@united it was an international flight, and we didn't get our new eta until we were in the air."
4051,United,@united - I think she was having a rough moment w/ a bad passenger from an earlier flight. Things got considerably better. Thanks!
4052,United,@united - thanks for the rude customer service and 3 hour delay. It really helped me timing wise for my afternoon meetings. Hello @Delta !
4053,United,"@united Useless response. I need a functioning wheelchair, not a customer care form to fill out."
4054,United,"@united awesome. Thx. And thx for replying so damn fast, sure as hell beats 80s cheeze hold music!!"
4055,United,"@united What does ""Cabin Functionality"" mean when I'm taking a customer satisfaction survey?"
4056,United,@united $55 cab ride to dfw from love got me my bag. Reimburse?
4057,United,@united @gg8929 Unbelievable hypocrisy!!
4058,United,@united thanks for not getting my BusinessFirst priority tagged bag onto my connecting flight at EWR despite a 2+ hour layover. Nice job
4059,United,"@united amazing flying over 25,000 miles on #UnitedAirlines &amp; alliance last year; still got jilted out of status! #moneyelsewhere"
4060,United,"@united On top of this, a CSR went ahead and hung up on me after I called United to discuss this."
4061,United,@united now finally in memphis. Landed 30 minutes ago. Still no bags. Paying for a service that just gets worse...
4062,United,"@united thanks for a terrible experience at EWR. Customers should be treated as a priority, not as an inconvenience #tryagain"
4063,United,"@united Some 3rd party service known as EZEE flights. A man, who confirmed he was born in India, told me his name was Steve Wilson."
4064,United,@united The third wheelchair is broken! http://t.co/tvk0PyxQv5
4065,United,"@united She met me from customer service at the arrival of flight UA3787 PVD-IAD. Thanks, you guys have really handled this storm!"
4066,United,@united ooh thanks!
4067,United,"@united my flight was at 1 pm. Still at the airport gee what service.  Do they care, nope.  Delayed until 7:55."
4068,United,@united very disappointed in CC. Purchased ticket online w/ voucher and charge full amnt. Would not hold price after refund. Unacceptable
4069,United,@united exactly it states a secure document is a nexus card. It does not state a passport must always be also presented. Read it
4070,United,"@united We were told by United to ""carry over/carry back"" for the refund."
4071,United,"@united no, I had to leave for work. Would have not been possible. So I would love to have this replaced now"
4072,United,I feel completely cheated @united. I read your commitment to customer service via website and def did not get service suggested there.
4073,United,"@united @annricord 0162431184663.
3 of your agents said we would be refunded. Agents said United should never have sold us the ticket."
4074,United,@united if your air traffic crew could get their shit together no one would notice the rudeness of the ground staff
4075,United,@united IT-problems with the link? #3thparty
4076,United,"@United: I feel very well informed. yes, the flight is indeed delayed. Thank you. http://t.co/FuCHZRZjg5"
4077,United,@united Why do I pay more for Coach Plus to be told preboarding that all overhead bins will be full for me
4078,United,@united can I get some help changing a ticket.  40 minutes on hold and counting....
4079,United,@united thanks for all the help! Totally appreciate it and you made it super easy too
4080,United,@united was told by Supervisor that United disconnected their customer support # so there was nobody to address it now. #igiveup
4081,United,@united Your MileagePlus signup page is broken.
4082,United,@united $7 for wifi just so I can tell my family I'm gonna be Late Flight cause i had to sit in a grounded plane for the past two hours...
4083,United,@united FYI: continuous texts and emails I am getting about the delay while held captive on the tarmac are not that helpful.
4084,United,"@united so, not only were you Late Flight, you broke my luggage handle. You paying for a new one? http://t.co/nYVV1X3d67"
4085,United,@united: No friendly skies from you today. 5hr+ weather delay in SFO followed by 1hr+ mechanical delay while sitting on plane. #NoFun
4086,United,@united once again your customer service rep was rude!   I asked a question and in turn got attitude.  Jane was no help.  Disgusted again!
4087,United,@united can you not see the thread?
4088,United,@united poor old United: never seem to get the response right :)
4089,United,@united obviously the staff at EWR - United or otherwise have not seen your ads about - being FRIENDLY and helpful #ewr worst airport
4090,United,@united also why can't I pre-select seats on SFO-&gt;YYZ flight? I'm a Canadian Flight Booking Problems on http://t.co/aZltJhf7lv.
4091,United,@united does forelock guarantee the fare only or fare &amp; seats?
4092,United,@united thanks! :)
4093,United,"Hypocrisy RT @united @gg8929 I'm sorry, we're not able to offer a full refund because the exchange rate is not what you were hoping for. ^KP"
4094,United,@united I shouldn't have to spend my own $$$ on a hotel because of a weather delay. The weather being something COMPLETELY OUT OF MY CONTROL
4095,United,@united  eventually.  You should approach bags like @AlaskaAir  they get it.
4096,United,@united What if my NYC flight is delayed and I miss my connection to Sacramento from Chicago?
4097,United,@united said they would give us a refund. 30 days Late Flightr NO refund.
4098,United,@united how can you not know the weight of our plane after us sitting on the plane for 2.5 hrs? Not convinced your company is safe for flt.
4099,United,@united we showed up to our flight several hours early. Tried to call &amp; was on hold 15 min b/f call disconnected.
4100,United,"@united if your policy changed, you must advise at the time of purchase.  Same if you choose to vary it by airport!  We want a FULL refund!!"
4101,United,"@united wanted to, but you Cancelled Flightled my tickets.... They were too special i guess even for united."
4102,United,@united I'm 0/3 for Flight Booking Problems without major problems. 0% isn't bad!üëéüëé
4103,United,@united @el_ingeniero don't check your baggage if you don't have to.  They will lose it!
4104,United,@United I'm hoping we don't miss our LAX - ITO connection. Not looking forward to being stuck at LAX overnight with our team....AGAIN!
4105,United,@united well perhaps you could highlight where that is stated.  We travel between Canada &amp; USA on United with only Nexus
4106,United,"@united how can you not know, after two hours of us sitting on the plane with no bags off loaded, the planes weight?!"
4107,United,@united You make it hard to fly with you. Delayed over an hour and now the plane  is turning around &amp; heading back to the gate. #connection?
4108,United,@united  Serious firing needs to happen at HNL. They broke the wheelchair you loaned me after you broke mine! http://t.co/bT37KyrByJ
4109,United,"@united Call customer service and of course they just say ""theres nothing we can do"" and then offer a transfer and disconnect the line."
4110,United,"@united Now submitted for the third time, please check and confirm receipt. Have taken screen shots in case it disappears again. Thanks"
4111,United,@united if our already rescheduled flight is Cancelled Flightled is our hotel room paid for?
4112,United,@united Classic
4113,United,@united Elizabeth at Washington Dulles just hooked me up with a new connecting flight at my gate! I'm super pleased!
4114,United,@united Thanks!
4115,United,"@united Does the economy plus cabin also qualifies as a ""premium"" cabin?"
4116,United,@united flight UA3364 been sitting on tarmac for 30 mins with no report as to why...any input?
4117,United,@united A 3rd party service you use to sell your tickets has ripped me off. Excellent service United is offering.
4118,United,@united no thanks
4119,United,"@united Yesterday, I'm sorted now."
4120,United,"@united thanks for that advice, so helpful. Can't believe you guys actually charge people to ""fly"" united"
4121,United,@united If you have had any issues with  United Airlines PLEASE retweet. Paid for a full fight ticket and was given a standby instead.
4122,United,@united just tried to log in and was told e-mail log in not currently available
4123,United,@united @gg8929 so why did you Cancelled Flight tickets for thousands of people when you didn't like the exchange rate? #doublestandards
4124,United,@united do you have an e-mail address I can write my account to? Might be less likely to disappear
4125,United,"@united so I wasted 40mins filling in 2 online forms you are telling me you didn't receive, how do I know this won't happen this time?"
4126,United,"@united 877 from amsterdam to ewr, 02.27.2015, 737-300."
4127,United,@united stuck here in IAH waiting on flight 253 to Honolulu for 7 hours due to maintenance issues. Could we have gotten a new plane!?!? Fail
4128,United,@united @UnitedAppeals @gg8929 What kind of hypocrisy is that? Only Cancelled Flightling tickets with bad exchange rate if in your advantage #united
4129,United,@united No. The entire problem here is that I was never sent anything via email and only given a Flight Booking Problems number over the phone.
4130,United,@united calling that number was useless. Heading to the airport now to pick up my bags. this whole situation seems like a real joke.
4131,United,@united They couldn't get me first class on any of their flights so I just rebooked myself.
4132,United,@united but the gate agent and club staff got me priority standby for next so might only be minor disaster...#travelingwithsmallkids
4133,United,@united I'll be sending/posting complete details of the circumstances surrounding this matter.  United airlines should be ashamed.
4134,United,@United Hidden City forces me into crappy seat even though exit row is available on the first leg. Your support cannot fix. :-(
4135,United,@united JT thanks for your help I‚Äôll complete the form once we are back home
4136,United,"@united missed it.  Incoming on time, then Sat for 30, then no jetbridge driver...missed a 45min connection from an on time flight..."
4137,United,@united @gg8929 Ladies and gents - United Airlines...
4138,United,@united You might be dealing with frustrated passenegers. hope you all have a great day :) thank you very much for an amazing airline :)
4139,United,@united Allright! Last question : the power outlets on my flight are available in the premium cabin. Does that include economy plus cabin?
4140,United,"@united Well, It's LA and then a 2hr+ car ride to a dark Palm Springs technically. Maybe I'll get bumped to 1st class Den to PHL on Friday:)"
4141,United,@united yes still need assistance I don't have a flight home due to change in flight u made I miss all connections !
4142,United,@united I believe you have to follow me in order for me send you a DM
4143,United,@united thanks! We would like an apology and a full refund. Please confirm when we will receive.
4144,United,"@united Hi, can you email me here so i can share the details? Thanks. frank@postsecret.com"
4145,United,@united But I got a bad exchange rate so want my money back. Please can you refund without penalty.
4146,United,"@united My flight UA1159 to Denver for #RMOUG15 has been re-cheduled 5 times.
If I am no show, you'll know why! Ridiculous."
4147,United,@united you're just using automated  responses and don't have the decency to actually care/respond
4148,United,@united JT the issue is with missed connections early gate closings and zero concern from customer service
4149,United,"@united here I was thinking how I could say so many nice things after getting upgraded, but then you delayed my flight... It's ok!"
4150,United,@united Can you explain how it rewards us elite Premiere 1K members?
4151,United,@united for our birthdays my fianc√© &amp; I want to travel Late Flight April. You're our fave airline but Frontier has this: http://t.co/uayWrr45as :-/
4152,United,@united I‚Äôm resending the confirmation code in a DM
4153,United,@united I did DM the details back on 02/14 when this started with phone number to reach me no reply either online or by phone
4154,United,@United Airlines' CEO Jeff Smisek: Disloyal to Loyal Workers http://t.co/0cevY3P42b via @HuffPostBiz
4155,United,"@united The guidelines say 10x9x17, my bag is 20x15.7x8.7, so it's a bit taller than the guidelines. Is that gonna be a problem?"
4156,United,@united thank you! I wish the lady in Little Rock had told me that in the morning when I asked her
4157,United,@united no claim number. Haven't been back to iAd baggage since. Is there a phone I can call to speak to someone?
4158,United,"@united do you think there Will problems at Newark, NJ on Saturday due to expected snow?"
4159,United,@united Got it.  I am following the United page.
4160,United,"@united Thank you for the speedy response! I figured it may be something of that nature. You guys and your ""fine print,"" haha"
4161,United,@united worst service ever üòà
4162,United,@united thanks for your attention. I would actually like to make a specific complaint about customer service at DCA. What is my best option?
4163,United,@united can't believe United can't find someone to just simply check a seat back for a missing passport. Loved United but debating choice
4164,United,@united I am furious.  You're firm is a disgrace. Despite all our efforts you did zero to protect our daughter. All alone at night # United
4165,United,@united holy high speed internet batman!  Speeds at United Club at IAD are insanely fast!  Thanks
4166,United,@united Your website Flight Booking Problems experience is an obnoxious upsell-laden disaster for anyone with half a brain.
4167,United,@united  @MrAndyEp like 2 weeks after my flight!?!? Creative!
4168,United,@united Flt 4487 is having some MAJOR delays bc ground crew was so SLOW. The flight crew has been terrific. Been 2 hours on the ground..üò°...
4169,United,"@united sorry, I hate united. i won't get to see my family until Thursday"
4170,United,@united Thanks for the timely service &amp; great staff getting my wife and me to and from Cancun this past week for our honeymoon.
4171,United,"@united done just now, thanks."
4172,United,@united Currently on standby to Lax then it is a 2 hour ride to Palm Springs. Long day starting at a snowy 3:30 am in philly.
4173,United,"@United Your customer service for Mileage Plus customers is a disgrace. I just spent 45 min on the phone to reset a pin number, with no luck"
4174,United,"@united No, I do not. I was only given a Flight Booking Problems reference number."
4175,United,@united All these changes. Way to stick it to your Premiere 1K loyal customers. Why make things harder for those that loyal to you?
4176,United,"@united thanks for the offer, but I finally made it to my destination, albeit hours Late Flight."
4177,United,@United Airlines Cancelled Flights OC FLL #flight today. $700 to switch. No notice no apology. We are done flying #UnitedAirlines.
4178,United,@united can you send me another confirmation email?
4179,United,@united it would be super if you paid as much attention to actual fliers as you do to credit card holders.
4180,United,@united I travel a lot and I get it. You're still my fave but EWR to Cleveland w/40 min layover to connect to DC = our best option? Come on.
4181,United,"@united 3pm and my bags still not here. not even a courtesy toiletries kit. not the flight experience I was expecting, very disappointed."
4182,United,@United Airlines Cancelled Flights OC FLL #flight today. $700 to switch. No notice no apology. Done flying #UnitedAirlines.
4183,United,"@united sorry, wrong link for the bag : http://t.co/pZAl4wtrEZ Thats the one i meant"
4184,United,"@united flight 86 LAX-IAD, back rows NOT CLEANED prior to boarding. How gross is that to find used tissues in your seat?  Please."
4185,United,@united thank you! üòä
4186,United,"@united take a lesson from @VirginAmerica , they know how to treat customers!"
4187,United,@united plus you horrible seating and poor customer service everywhere I've flown. now you take away the mileage program..horrible
4188,United,@united you'd learn if you listen to your customers...you do want you want...@VirginAmerica asks their customer what they want
4189,United,@united customer service üëé
4190,United,@united Priceless. United stranded my daughter at O'Hare. United did zero to keep her safe.....alone on a plastic chair for 9h! # United Air
4191,United,"@united Hi again, any updates here?"
4192,United,@united Could you tell me if this bag would be accepted as a personal item ? Can i bring one carry-on bag plus this? http://t.co/U390cZpLHl

4195,United,@united thanks finally made it.. Missed meetings but what can I do now?
4196,United,@united Our flight was originally supposed to leave at 1:40pm &amp; now we won't leave until 5. This is the 2nd time this has happened
4197,United,"@united Supposedly, they're out for delivery. I'll believe it when I see it."
4198,United,"@united Thank you. Yes, I was hoping to speak with someone directly, but appreciate the link nonetheless. :)"
4199,United,@united Sure did! Only waited about 15min. Yay!
4200,United,"@united Hi JH, my experience with United has been entirely disgusting but yes, I'd like assistance in getting compensated for my bag."
4201,United,@united took this picture on Thursday. #awesome http://t.co/IVGpZSjtkW
4202,United,@united probably wouldn't be doing it had someone returned my call or email. Case number 8273993
4203,United,"@united I can't even fit my name on the first two lines, yes... Please do pass on feedback. This is a big downgrade from previous years."
4204,United,Is expiring the @united offer to buy or transfer #United #MileagePlus miles with discount? Many offers during a year http://t.co/6tz6imqZlG
4205,United,"@united no, it was 2 flight Cancelled Flightlations (one due to weather, one mechanical) paid own hotel, bag held in transfer. No voucher/compensation"
4206,United,@united i got email that my reservations got Cancelled Flightled and i will be refunded.  Nothing got refunded as of yet
4207,United,@united So what do you offer now that my flight was Cancelled Flighted and I'm stranded away from home and work?
4208,United,@united you are really trying me today.
4209,United,@united looks like I'm settled in to where I'm going.  Thx.
4210,United,@united flt 4567 has had two more updates in the last 3 minutes.
4211,United,@united no they were to busy taking to each other and I needed to get to an audition.
4212,United,@united was never given one
4213,United,@united quick response offering assistance but lack of follow through - not really the service I was expecting
4214,United,@united Stuck in IAD going on 6 hours waiting for a ferry flight from Nashville that u can't tell when it will arrive?!! Ridiculous!!
4215,United,"@united flt 4567 no gate agent, no announcements. So unprofessional. Time to go back to @Delta"
4216,United,"@united Thanks, ^KP. Please also mention the Quiche breakfast and Tandoori chicken dinner entrees and accompaniments are truly First Class."
4217,United,@united flt. 4567 departure time has changed five times in the last 20 minutes. Why don't you figure out a solution and announce once?
4218,United,@united bags are still in Houston since Friday and still have not been reimbursed the baggage fee.
4219,United,@united who can tell me where they are?
4220,United,"@united flight 4567 have already been Cancelled Flightled once, been trying to get home two days. Staff being very unhelpful."
4221,United,@united each flight is worse than last! flight attendants don't even know whether the plane is equipped with power outlets at the seats!
4222,United,@united flight 4567 agent now wandered off. Pilots came out looking for her. Went to charge her personal phone which she'd been txting on
4223,United,@united waiting for flight 4567 to memphis. Incredibly rude gate agent waited until after departure time to announce delay. (1 of 2) #rude
4224,United,@united I don't see how I need to spend an extra $100 bc of ur equipment failure.
4225,United,@united I don't need to make any changes. I reserved my seats when I bought my tickets and there was an error &amp; now there are no comp seats
4226,United,@united its 2015 and no power outlets at the seats on a 6 hour flight to California? Seriously? This is why airlines are failing!! Pathetic!
4227,United,@united thanks kp but luckily my transfer has maintenance issues and is still delayed so I didn't miss my transfer...
4228,United,"@united No, not received any e-mails in either Inbox or junk/spam"
4229,United,@united - could you please send me a phone # to the refunds department?  We have submitted our claim through email without success.
4230,United,"@united I'm not this person, but I've been sitting in Denver for three hours and all I want to do is get on a plane. Please let me go home."
4231,United,@united  flight 441 on 2/4 was delayed over three hours because the pilot never showed up!
4232,United,@united I just need to get to RIC tonight. I've been in EWR for 24hrs now.
4233,United,@united which is why my next flights to Miami will be on another airline.
4234,United,@united It is super frustrating that the folks at the United Ticket Counter in Pittsburg aren't honoring their own Media Rate! #unitedfail
4235,United,@united 45 minutes after arrival and no bags for most people. UA469 from den to ewr. How long should we wait until a ual rep comes here?
4236,United,@united What is the policy behind changing passengers' seating assignments at the gate?
4237,United,@united with Karen and found her unhelpful and rude  called United at the time &amp; told she could board but Karen would not accept
4238,United,"@united she has crossed 4 prior times with other carriers and no issue. Karen was rude, untrained and unhelpful I also spoke"
4239,United,"@united nexus confirmed that at any crossing via air, car or boat she can travel with only Nexus."
4240,United,@united 2 employee yelled at her. 3 employee stood with others whispering and pointing at her from behind counter
4241,United,@united 1 refused boarding with Nexus. nexus confirmed she should not be refused
4242,United,"@united on a good note, the 2 employees I encountered @ Newark were fabulous. I was very Late Flight for my connecting flight and they got me on!!!"
4243,United,@united u lost my bag and would not refund my bag fee? Does that make sense to you? And yes I already called cust svc. They said no.
4244,United,@United yall tried it with this little bitty plane flying out of boston!! I hate little planes!!!
4245,United,"@united doing a good thing, holding flight for a few for 11 peeps on Late Flight connecting flight. We'll still make destination on time"
4246,United,@united Q: Just purchased ticket to #Hawaii for trip in Late Flight-March. Does this mean we will acquire miles based on price or distance flown?
4247,United,@united stay warm - I will be passing through Chicago next week
4248,United,@united the refund request functionality on http://t.co/5IMDckODfx is broken.i get a time out error.
4249,United,@united @NY_NJairports Only at Newark can you land 15 minutes early but lose all that time waiting on tarmac for a gate.
4250,United,@united giving up on your direct flight from IAH to Honolulu. 3rd attempt in 3 years - 3rd delay.  $7 meal voucher. Wow. Customer service!
4251,United,"@United just played the Most bizarre ""safety"" video I've ever seen... http://t.co/Hlm2Oks6xl"
4252,United,@united Nearly 48 hours Late Flightr and still no idea where it is. I will never fly United again if I can help it.
4253,United,@united 1591 had wi-fi broken on plane. Had same outage on 1618 on Friday. How can Southwest get it right on every plane but United can't?
4254,United,@United WiFi onboard 737-800 far superior in pricing and performance (user-perceived bandwidth and Late Flightncy) to recent @GoGo experiences.
4255,United,@united Second day &amp; attempt trying to leave IAD &amp; I'm on another plane delayed for mechanical issues. Over an hour delayed!
4256,United,@united Is there a direct number to call to request a refund?  Its telling me its not valid as I changed the ticket.  No number on site
4257,United,@united when is my plane coming?  Been delayed for almost 7 hours. No plane.
4258,United,@united Not fast enough.  No excuse for service between big hubs to have such outdated craft. Southwest has wifi. This is awful.
4259,United,@united thankful for great service in Newark. Seats fixed and I was seated with my daughter! Fab landing in Fort Myers!
4260,United,@united my mother's flight was delayed from phl-ord. We're on our way to NRT and the gate refused to upgrade. A platinum.  Blegh
4261,United,@united is Late Flight again.  Everyone braved the weather and 40 passengers are waiting for a flight crew.  Really!
4262,United,@united Miserable trip ... lost bag Sat... found Mon... lost again... shipping 2nd day ground Tues... might have it for return flight home
4263,United,@united spending the afternoon @ Mia. Not your fault.  No lounge? Very inconvenient.
4264,United,@united costumer service sucks! Waiting for a week for a response
4265,United,"@united Is there a way to get  a copy of Feb's edition of Hemisphere
magazine with out flying?"
4266,United,@united I somehow think I'm going to be stuck paying for a hotel room in Denver without winter clothes on my dime.  I guess we'll see.
4267,United,"@united I normally ask people to put on headphones...but not toddlers. Maybe planes should have a ""kid"" section (near the back) ;)"
4268,United,@united of course I need help.  I've been DMing you ladies and gents all day. Your only solution is hope for the best and LAX.
4269,United,@united Confirmation number: NJV4BP - All I need is email confirmation of flight from NYC - SFO Feb 4

4273,United,"@united I was denied use of a rear facing car seat on UA5025, an ERJ145. Can you confirm the actual policy?"
4274,United,"@united you better hold my flight to Tucson #5237, just landed in Houston after an hour delay for some minor computer problem"
4275,United,Thx! Stand by! ‚Äú@united: @rajuchinthala I know it's frustrating and I do appreciate your patience while we try to get you on your way. ^JH‚Äù
4276,United,"@united roundtrip tickets to NJ are DRAMATICALLY cheaper through Virgin, pretty pricey via United. Can you match them?"
4277,United,"@united dropped off a luggage at IAD over 2 months ago for repair from damages haven't heard anything about it since, when do I get it back?"
4278,United,@united that's what I thought! Thanks for the clarification!
4279,United,@united feck guys. Stop Cancelled Flightling flights from EWR to RIC the weather is fine I both locations!!!
4280,United,"@united + UA has been rolling out improvements too, we think. Hoping they'll catch up soon? Meantime, ANA is our preference!"
4281,United,"@united @FlyANA_official pleasantly surprised to find ANA has made major upgrades on their transpacific route in flights, planes and service"
4282,United,@united Step 1: Cancelled Flight flight. Step 2: Don't notify customer. Step 3: Charge them for food while they try to survive their wait. Brilliant.
4283,United,@united i need my confirmation number! Can you give it to me?
4284,United,"@united + besides, no small degree of self-interest. We take that route several times a year &amp; would hate to be in that situation."
4285,United,.@united we rebooked. But @casleah and I had to split up and take different flights because a pilot ran out of hours? Frustrating.
4286,United,"@united no worries about the tweets. We all should do what we can to make sure we, as in your tag line, ""Fly the Friendly Skies."""
4287,United,@united @jsumiyasu I am thankful to the  United ground staff who put me in the last seat on the last flight out. Home Late Flight is still home!
4288,United,@united I appreciate the follow up.
4289,United,@united + that's the gist of what the flight attendant told her.
4290,United,@united BTW is it true you have to remind flight staff after checking in even after indicating meal prefer on your reservation? +
4291,United,"@united +what took me aback was the response by the flight attendant, who put the responsibility squarely back on passenger's shoulders. +"
4292,United,@united No but u cld explain how such a disorganized and inefficient company w surly and obviously unhappy employees stays in business.
4293,United,@united sat at airport for 5 hrs still sitting at gate..  Sigh
4294,United,@united actually we did not consider she might have made a mistake. She did not complain beyond that she indicated it on her reservation.
4295,United,@united Gold Star for united- change my flight- miss all connections- but can't accommodate me until a MUCH Late Flightr arrival time-Not HAPPY!

4304,United,@united didn't get her name. She was not in our group. She was sitting behind us. Think it was window seat #40? We only overheard...
4305,United,@united You know what the United Club needs? Power. MOAR power. Insufficient outlets for the #RoadWarrior (ORD)
4306,United,@united THRILLED to have my carry-on checked against my will by two nasty gate agents only to see an entire empty bin when I boarded last...
4307,United,@united what if business as usual meant dropping the bully mentality and fostering inspiration for a greater business #EmployeeRelations
4308,United,"@United - Ridiculous to fly outdated 757s anywhere much less btwn IAH and SFO. No power ports, no  Wifi, no personal entertainment. TORTURE"

4310,United,"@united Broken entertainment system on my 8 hour NYC flight, terrible cabin crew service and online complaint form won't work #hopeless"

4791,Southwest,@SouthwestAir loved it!
4792,Southwest,@SouthwestAir needs to train their employees to be at lease somewhat empathetic when THEY lose our luggage.  Monika at MWA needs a PR lesson
4793,Southwest,"@SouthwestAir I am in, let's do this!"
4794,Southwest,@SouthwestAir You completely let me down tonight. Your gate agents' ambivalence is just too much. How sad for you (&amp; me.)

4800,Southwest,@SouthwestAir @jparkermastin  customer service has been very passive in their response. Disappointed. I have only flown SW but am rethinking
4801,Southwest,@SouthwestAir broke the stroller my wife and baby gate checked. They told her it's not their problem. Calling the A List Preferred line now.
4802,Southwest,@SouthwestAir is this a joke? My return flight is delayed too! 3 in a row! New record from you guys üíîüò™
4803,Southwest,@SouthwestAir nbd I was able to figure out a workaround. Just wanted to help. Got my bags less than 24 hours Late Flightr. Muchas grassy ass.
4804,Southwest,@SouthwestAir luggage delivery between 1-4am? Really? After I was told by midnight multiple times? Why lie? Crazy and bad business.
4805,Southwest,.@SouthwestAir Thx for the follow up. Just sent DM
4806,Southwest,@SouthwestAir now I don't get the common courtesy of my phone call answered. Either policy is bad or people should be fired. #dissaponted
4807,Southwest,@SouthwestAir TY for your consideration!
4808,Southwest,@SouthwestAir apologies are whatever. Please just deliver the bags like you said you would. Feel like employees are lying to me.
4809,Southwest,@SouthwestAir what robot is running this account. The same one that doesn't remember anything they ask. Same conversation over and over.
4810,Southwest,"@SouthwestAir It was never really ""lost"" it was put on another flight WITH my knowledge we just weren't sure what flight but I have it - TY!"

4831,Southwest,"@SouthwestAir I need to Cancelled Flight one leg of a flight, but can't seem to do this online. Been on hold on the phone for 10 minutes. Any help?"

4842,Southwest,@SouthwestAir I'm flying out of CUN tomorrow To DEN - can I change my flight due to the travel advisory??
4843,Southwest,@SouthwestAir Tough I can take. Zero meaningful assistance while stranded for 2 days is another matter. Looking for signs you care abt cust.
4844,Southwest,@SouthwestAir Don't apologize. Do something about it. Words mean nothing. Actions work. EOM.
4845,Southwest,@SouthwestAir after an hour and a half then it came back damaged. Not happy üò£
4846,Southwest,@SouthwestAir how long does it take for my Rapid Rewards points to be credited to my account?
4847,Southwest,@SouthwestAir why does the customer service have rather inconsistent information
4848,Southwest,@SouthwestAir we're pulling off the runway now! Making new friends with seat mates. Thanks for the response CB.
4849,Southwest,@SouthwestAir but to make us tru to find space in other flights.  This customer service is as bad as @SpiritAirlines.
4850,Southwest,@SouthwestAir no delay. I pay $777.70 for BS A1 ticket. You boarded flight early. I'm last to board. Now have middle seat. Wasted $$$$!
4851,Southwest,"@SouthwestAir first you had a good idea thatthis would happen and did not Cancelled Flight it earlier, then very amateurish that there was no plan."
4852,Southwest,@SouthwestAir very disappointed in your handling of tonight's Cancelled Flighted Dallas flight.  Not that it was Cancelled Flighted but no contingencies.
4853,Southwest,@SouthwestAir it's ok! Southwest is still the best airline around! Just hate when baggage room runs out.. My now checked bag has headphones!

5712,Southwest,@SouthwestAir save mile to visit family in 2015 and this will impact how many times I can see my mother.  I planned and you change the rules
5713,Southwest,@SouthwestAir Jackpot!  #legroom http://t.co/ZO2iceG4lI
5714,Southwest,"@SouthwestAir you were my go to airline now not so much!! You say you care but I now see not so much! Right now, you suck!!"
5715,Southwest,@SouthwestAir I have been loyal to Southwest from the beginning but very unhappy about your devaluation.
5716,Southwest,@SouthwestAir #DestinationDragons iD is my favorite band and i met my 2bestfriends thanks to them! it would be life changing to see them!
5717,Southwest,"@SouthwestAir i live in the southwest, Imagine Dragons is my favorite band, and i met my 2bestfriends thanks to them. it would be amazing +"
5718,Southwest,@SouthwestAir  Longer flights with 300 series no wifi? Will be great when you retire them.
5719,Southwest,"@southwestair excruciatingly slow internet on SWA flights is now the norm, rather than the exception. Is this being addressed?"
5720,Southwest,"@SouthwestAir yes, thank you. Just sent DM."
5721,Southwest,@SouthwestAir when is the last chance to get #DestinationDragons tickets? I would die of happiness if I won üò≠üôè
5722,Southwest,@SouthwestAir The in-browser hover over is intrusive and annoying. And the fact that the WiFi only works on one device is sort of sad.
5723,Southwest,"@SouthwestAir the sign in screen had major mobile issues, the responsive design wasn't working properly my Nexus 5."
5724,Southwest,@SouthwestAir sure did. Also read on there that Southwest doesn't believe it is liable for the incident. How is it my fault that SW lost it?
5725,Southwest,@SouthwestAir What's up with the new in-flight WiFi service? Super crappy user experience. Miss the old provider. :(
5726,Southwest,@SouthwestAir it's too damn cold to be sitting on this runway with no heat!!!!!

5731,Southwest,"@SouthwestAir Repeating this is policy is basically repeating ""Fuck you"" to your customers. I'll be shopping for a new airline ASAP"
5732,Southwest,"@SouthwestAir yeah... that's not what happened. I'm really pissed. This is the kind of thing I expect from US or Austrian, not you."
5733,Southwest,@SouthwestAir  Glad to see you know how to keep the money in your own pockets. 'Thanks' for the voucher in return for lost bag.

5741,Southwest,@SouthwestAir Thank you! I can't wait either :)

5758,Southwest,"@SouthwestAir Promotion also said two free round trip flights. Nope, had to pay $200 extra for chi to Vegas. Bait&amp;switch."
5759,Southwest,"@SouthwestAir so for an extra luggage, it cost $75????"
5760,Southwest,@SouthwestAir turned my non-stop flight between Laguardia/dal into a 1 stop in STL. WTH? I'm thinking some sorta comp is in order? REALLY?

5782,Southwest,"@SouthwestAir I have never been mor e disappointed in a company, charging $8 to use your wifi which only works for about 8 apps parhetic"
5783,Southwest,@SouthwestAir  Just picked up my bag at SEATAC all the clothes are soaking wet... #bagawim http://t.co/nGxAl9OmL6
5784,Southwest,@SouthwestAir would be cool if the best airlines company hooked me up with @Imaginedragons tickets for Vegas ;)

5786,Southwest,@SouthwestAir Can you help me out with tickets to the Vegas event? I would be so stoked!

5795,Southwest,@SouthwestAir Paid for in flight wifi from Austin to San Diego - wasn't useable. :/ Possible to get a refund? Conf #8X7XVM
5796,Southwest,@SouthwestAir It was the usually excellent SWA flight!
5797,Southwest,@SouthwestAir you know I ‚ù§Ô∏èyou but trying my patience - had easier cheaper ways from TPA to PDX but stuck w u. Turned my 3 hrs in MCI to 6
5798,Southwest,@SouthwestAir I figured the streaming wouldn't work per the TOS but just the @NASCAR site is taking longer than 5 minutes to load
5799,Southwest,"@SouthwestAir now we have to wait, and wait to get it straight. I fly you for personal and business. But now, not so sure. #BeBetter"
5800,Southwest,@SouthwestAir because your gate attendant let someone board whose boarding pass kept reading invalid. This messed up the passenger log.
5801,Southwest,@SouthwestAir Your #Android Wi-Fi experience is terrible! $8 is a ripoff! I can't get to @NASCAR or MRN for @DISupdates #BudweiserDuels
5802,Southwest,"@SouthwestAir Dear SWA, I fly you a lot.   Most of the time, amazing. Today: unacceptable.I am sitting here in Midway delayed 20 min...."
5803,Southwest,"@SouthwestAir, what do you know? Finally lined up like cattle to board my SW flight (after original departure time) #badcustomerservice"
5804,Southwest,@SouthwestAir seems like you could make more money by opening up seats on a more desirable flight.

5810,Southwest,@southwestair I have a roundtrip ticket now and I need to change one leg of the trip (to a nearby airport) - not possible via website?
5811,Southwest,@SouthwestAir please do something about the speed of your WiFi connections on your planes.  It might as well be non-existent.
5812,Southwest,@SouthwestAir Your crew on 4028 tonight was outstanding. God bless them and the medically trained passengers on board.
5813,Southwest,@SouthwestAir Weather seriously cannot even be the only excuse at this point because it was awful service in the summer too. Over it.
5814,Southwest,@SouthwestAir is seriously THE WORST. I don't remember the last time I or someone I knew had a flight that wasn't delayed / Cancelled Flightled / etc!
5815,Southwest,@SouthwestAir Is there any way to get entry to the Las Vegas event to see @Imaginedragons perform? #DestinationDragons
5816,Southwest,@SouthwestAir...give the crew of SWA 4007 a high five from this AV-8B guy for its nice XW landing into @bostonlogan. Nicely done!
5817,Southwest,@SouthwestAir why do you charge so much moving from a full flight to an earlier flight with seats available?  doesn't make sense to me.

6882,Delta,‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/Vxn2J36M7V‚Äù this happened
6883,Delta,@JetBlue - Definitely no note from whoever stole from me.
6884,Delta,@JetBlue but the 4 hour policy- when I called and they said I didn't report it soon enough. What would have changed if I had noticed sooner?
6885,Delta,@JetBlue - Hopefully that will help someone in the future. Would there have been a different procedure if I had discovered the theft sooner?
6886,Delta,@JetBlue - I did that as soon as I realized. Will they try to figure out who is stealing from people's bags? Security cameras? Anything?
6887,Delta,"@JetBlue - I did, but since I was stranded in SYR without a ride I missed the window of opportunity to have rights in this matter. (4 hours)"

7269,Delta,@JetBlue ok thanks. Safety first.
7270,Delta,@JetBlue apparently the plane was delayed coming up from San Juan. Monsoon there today?
7271,Delta,@JetBlue that's ok! It just sure seemed like it when JetBlue tweeted us back and asked us to send selfies of us watching.. Haha
7272,Delta,@JetBlue over 2 hour delay going from NYC to Denver! Come on man!
7273,Delta,@JetBlue @amybruni @DIRECTTV No Oscars on Direct TV on this flight. We were so looking forward to it. We were devastated. :-/
7274,Delta,"@JetBlue - Fix your @#$&amp; jet bridges.  40 minute delay, 2nd gate...still waiting!  #jetblues http://t.co/ncB2oNcS9i"
7275,Delta,Kudos well deserved! Just wish the rest of my @JetBlue experience today measured up to their example!
7276,Delta,"@JetBlue ha ha! Can I get a wake up call at boarding time please?  Large coffee, extralight extra sweet please!"
7277,Delta,@JetBlue didn't work. Fly-fi plus couldn't access ABC app. So I spent $19 and still missed Oscars. #disappointed
7278,Delta,@JetBlue üëç. I think I'll come take a nap at the terminal.  ;)
7279,Delta,@JetBlue Safety might be your priority but organization clearly is not.
7280,Delta,@JetBlue @zakkohane pretty sure he's saying Ricoh had great service down at BOS ;) #happytohelp
7281,Delta,@JetBlue #611 from JFK to LAS still delayed?
7282,Delta,"@JetBlue the lack of TV made it rough, that's literally why I picked y'all over the competitors."
7283,Delta,@JetBlue But not reddit? I work for the site and this is ridiculous.
7284,Delta,@JetBlue THANK YOU! I am your new big fan :)
7285,Delta,@JetBlue I do! The best airline wifi ever. Thank you!
7286,Delta,@JetBlue you just tight that you're #59 on the world's best airlines list &amp; @VirginAtlantic is ranked higher! @VirginAtlantic here I come!
7287,Delta,@JetBlue i only take jetblue to travel and i have to go to maimi next year but you guys dont go to maimiüò≠ why dont you guys go to maimi???
7288,Delta,@JetBlue such a bummer.  But I understand it's a business deal. Thanks for answering me!  Much less sad now.
7289,Delta,@JetBlue aka take stuff out of the checked bag! Then just carry on the extra weight. For someone just had shoulder surgery that's just no
7290,Delta,"@JetBlue pilot: ""Don't worry folks there's a backup for the backup for every part of this plane."" Thanks guy"
7291,Delta,@JetBlue Can you take @Cosmopolitan off your blacklist... trying to work :(
7292,Delta,"@JetBlue ""Goodwill"" now at $125.00.  $27,000 x ? = Fine   Still want your new CEO to make a public apology to all passengers of flight 136"
7293,Delta,@JetBlue thank you! Hopefully it's soon! We are supposed to leave at 11:23
7294,Delta,@JetBlue thank you!
7295,Delta,@JetBlue awesome
7296,Delta,"@JetBlue okay so anything using contactless EMV should work, just your internal testing and training is currently Apple Pay specific?"
7297,Delta,@JetBlue hard when you're with your younger siblings and cousin and they just want to go on the airplane. We should get better than this
7298,Delta,@JetBlue had a potentially stressful situation in reFlight Booking Problems a flight which she diffused and helped make awesome!
7299,Delta,"@JetBlue even tho the extra 5 lbs are still going on the plane, just as a carry on. Where is the sense? What do you say to fat people?"
7300,Delta,@JetBlue I thought being a mosaic member had 'perks' the best part is instead of checking the extra 5lbs I'm carrying it on üòí
7301,Delta,@JetBlue are yall going bankrupt or is inflation just really bad these days? You went from $50 to $120 for overweight fees! Outrageous
7302,Delta,@JetBlue  if only the show was on the flight.  No ABC.  Oh well.  I'll live.  #nexttime #andthewinneris...
7303,Delta,@JetBlue ill call in the morning. too upset right now.
7304,Delta,@JetBlue im still waiting??? No answer!!
7305,Delta,@JetBlue Ok. Thanks for your help.
7306,Delta,@JetBlue Love you guysüòçüòçüòç http://t.co/3X9NRUOvtS
7307,Delta,"@JetBlue the amount of money I spent on hotels for a WEEK bc of flight Cancelled Flightlation, another flight doesn't make up for the money lost."
7308,Delta,@JetBlue being told JFK had a 5 hour delay this AM which is reason for my delay now. It can't be that hard to notify with 12 hours notice
7309,Delta,@JetBlue by far the worst airline in terms of service at jfk.
7310,Delta,"Keep Waiting, time does not cost anything for @JetBlue hundreds people how payed thousand dollars with no feedback http://t.co/Ji2pg4gom9"
7311,Delta,@JetBlue you're still the best
7312,Delta,"@JetBlue @ABCNetwork please give JetBlue all the permissions in the world! I'm missing the oscars right now, and it's awful #whyabcwhy"
7313,Delta,@JetBlue Thanks. So the delay was the result of scheduling issues more than weather reLate Flightd problems?
7314,Delta,"@JetBlue @shannonwoodward I'll be checking often. Most probably when they hand the oscars out to the nerds, geeks and badly dressed."
7315,Delta,@JetBlue I am less concerned about the delay than I am about not being notified until I looked at the board that my flight was delayed
7316,Delta,@JetBlue Thanks!  I made it üòÉ
7317,Delta,"@JetBlue after boarding flight 0510, the captain informs that he could exceed the16 hrs regulation and turned the plane around. Incredible!"
7318,Delta,@JetBlue thanks for the quick response! Fingers crossed the plane gets here then
7319,Delta,"@JetBlue @julesdameron ""Considering?"" #Accessibility is an absolute MUST! #Equality"
7320,Delta,@JetBlue how do we watch the oscars though right now?! No abc on flight :( #missingtheoscars
7321,Delta,@JetBlue Thank you. Fingers crossed.
7322,Delta,".@JetBlue ooookay @ABC that's silly of you. guess we're ""watching"" the oscars purely on Twitter reactions tonight. #oscars"
7323,Delta,@JetBlue I've heard your new in flight tap to pay readers accept ONLY Apple Pay. I thought that was impossible &amp; certainly not EMV compliant
7324,Delta,@JetBlue you're taking me to New Orleans in two weeks so I'll picture that while I shiver #forevercold
7325,Delta,@JetBlue We're flight 1472 FFL to LGA. Scheduled departure 8:15p.
7326,Delta,"@JetBlue 2nd time in a row a flight out of jfk a disaster. Last time I wasn't allowed to fly stndby, now a 2 hour delay w/out notification"
7327,Delta,@JetBlue oh right! Me and hundred people arrived back to the same gate we left minutes ago in SDQ http://t.co/7gB0hgW51t
7328,Delta,@JetBlue. A bunch of flights are delayed from FFL to Northeast destinations. No announcements at the gate. What's going on?
7329,Delta,@jetblue I'm dissapointed in the way paseengers on flight 0510 in Santo Domingo have been treated. 9hrs to board the plane and no info given
7330,Delta,@JetBlue id appreciate that. Would also you mind contacting the pilot of my flight and request that I be allowed to announce over intercom?
7331,Delta,"@shannonwoodward If you want, we can keep you updated on who's wearing who, &amp; who's with who, &amp; who wins what. We're nice like that. ;)"
7332,Delta,@JetBlue  I did.  They have no idea where it is.
7333,Delta,@JetBlue thanks but still annoying. Especially if I miss my flight. üòâ Can I tweet at the TSA??
7334,Delta,"@JetBlue hey JetBlue.  Still waiting to hear where you lost my 9'8"" surfboard between JFK and BQN airports."
7335,Delta,@JetBlue your gif game is strong.
7336,Delta,@JetBlue well but for now the only thng we can do is wait for someone to explain us the situation with responsibility http://t.co/ML1JaCpmch
7337,Delta,@JetBlue flight 98 DEN to JFK already 2hrs delayed. Any idea how that might change again due to weather forecast etc?
7338,Delta,@JetBlue Why close prechk at 8PM on a Sunday at JFK?  #annoying
7339,Delta,@JetBlue your crew didn't say it was about safety. If they say that I was glad to stay ... Check the information you give to the costumers
7340,Delta,@JetBlue you quite possibly ruined my entire first day in South Florida bc of your disorganization. #GetItTogether
7341,Delta,@JetBlue I'm going to write a post on @Medium about the experience. Your customer service has tanked. #JetBlue
7342,Delta,@JetBlue Still no response from CEO. I guess he is at the Oscars.  I bet his flight was on time.  #JUSTWRONG
7343,Delta,"@JetBlue okay. Names of SJ crew are Alamo, Tatiana. Keep telling me to hold, then leave desk. Ali told me he couldn't help bc going on break"
7344,Delta,"@JetBlue aha, ok. Thanks! Was worried there might not be a seat at all :) Will do it at the airport tomorrow then!"
7345,Delta,@JetBlue that is a stock response. Delays not as frustrating as poor cust serv &amp; being told by 3 ppl to wait &amp; they'd come back but did not.
7346,Delta,@JetBlue Ricoh Smith at BOS provided oust and service
7347,Delta,@JetBlue 4 hr delay on flight to JFK via Tampa &amp; worst customer service in San Juan airport. This after app not working all day.
7348,Delta,@JetBlue just please get my luggage from #2070 onto carousel 5 / Logan Airport and I'll be able to go home!
7349,Delta,@JetBlue what happens when I have a confirmed flight but no seat available during online checkin except for Even More Space upgrades?
7350,Delta,@JetBlue thanks for the response. Just been waiting for 5 hours and really frustrated. Seems like no one at JetBlue is concerned.
7351,Delta,@JetBlue Tx for the info. Just don't understand why you couldn't accurately estimate departure time earlier. Weather in ny is fine now.
7352,Delta,@JetBlue hey me and my family have questions on a trip to Disney world that we are doing in April . Please follow me so I could dm you guys
7353,Delta,‚Äú@JetBlue: @FinleyBklynCFS So glad to hear. Thanks for sharing the video.‚Äù Me and JetBlue are #BFF üôè
7354,Delta,@JetBlue no m'good. Just get me home
7355,Delta,@JetBlue thanks for the response. We are hopeful.
7356,Delta,@JetBlue Update please on why flight 2601 continues to be further delayed
7357,Delta,"@JetBlue ok, tx. Will tell the guy sitting next to me at the gate"
7358,Delta,@JetBlue thank you for not even coming with a solution. Great service I might say...as a TrueBlue member I am totally dissatisfied...thanks
7359,Delta,@JetBlue all day
7360,Delta,@JetBlue how about free wifi on flt 1254 out of PBI to make up for 2.5 hr delay? Treat us right.
7361,Delta,@JetBlue why is flight 1106 delayed out to NY? Same problem?
7362,Delta,@JetBlue Is that a guarantee? We'll see about that tomorrow morning when I have to fight for a seat.
7363,Delta,@JetBlue thanks for the update. 'Preciate it. Hope it gets here. Been delayed 2 days getting back
7364,Delta,@JetBlue yes. They are working on it. Hoping bag is on the next flight and will deliver home...
7365,Delta,@JetBlue WELL...my paid tickets have NO assigned seats at all. So essentially I won't be on this flight unless I pay more.
7366,Delta,@JetBlue If seats aren't guaranteed why do we pay for them? when I called the rep said some other people booked our seats.
7367,Delta,@JetBlue thank you for the refund of the change fee for a recent flight affected by our bizarre winter. Excellent customer service and focus
7368,Delta,"@JetBlue yes, please get me the seats we paid for."
7369,Delta,@JetBlue Flight 136 departs 2:14 AM  Finally!!!  Arrived JFK with no psgrs at 5:39 PM.  That's a long flight. AKA BUS http://t.co/KfKjF1ZtGi
7370,Delta,@JetBlue thanks for help. Can't wait to travel with! And get out of the snow.
7371,Delta,@JetBlue Help - I left my Nikon camera under the seat in front of me. What do I do?
7372,Delta,"@JetBlue I hope your customer service reps are as reliable/friendly as they usually are, so far you are not living up to your + rep/exper."
7373,Delta,@jetblue the man with the smell left nd now there's this stupid girl asking me questions. can yall help.
7374,Delta,"FYI, @JetBlue: The last email response - ""we undrstnd this wasnt best 4 you"" -but hope 2 wlcm u back onbrd N the future...   nice touch. lol"
7375,Delta,@JetBlue I think I have it selected already ‚ò∫Ô∏è
7376,Delta,"@JetBlue last flight was Cancelled Flightled, then it was 2 hours to change a light bulb, now sitting here waiting for maintenance. Unreal."
7377,Delta,@JetBlue thanks for answering my questions!
7378,Delta,@JetBlue that wasn't delayed or cabcelled
7379,Delta,@JetBlue I have to say that JetBlue has officially lost a customer. What a waste of all the points I have too! I am yet to be in a flight..
7380,Delta,@Jetblue  I will keep on tweeting until your CEO answers and personally apologizes to my wife and the passengers of flight 136. Just Wrong!!
7381,Delta,@JetBlue I think it's safe to say that after 25 years of loyal #JetBlue flying we are officially DONE. #Byebyejetblue
7382,Delta,"@JetBlue I have someone driving me, it's best to get a wheelchair once I get inside?"
7383,Delta,@JetBlue finally! Finally!
7384,Delta,"@JetBlue Token $75.00 Goodwill Voucher for passengers stuck on flight 136 from Phoenix today. 3 hour mark. How about a $27,000 per passenger"
7385,Delta,@JetBlue anything serious I should worry about?
7386,Delta,@JetBlue cool! Are there stairs at JFK? I can walk short distances but not stairs.
7387,Delta,@JetBlue Think about it...boarding to a chill untz untz untz....like this http://t.co/lj2lARivE0...
7388,Delta,@JetBlue Why are you making it so freaking hard for me to say good things about you??  #jetbluefail http://t.co/v8SB0RBICx
7389,Delta,"@JetBlue Seriously, what is your solution? Who exactly will help my 5 year old if there's a problem with the plane? http://t.co/vPDRPLXj5a"
7390,Delta,@JetBlue Your scheduling skills failed. The delay went from four hours to nearly six. Don't tell me you were snowbound in PBI.
7391,Delta,@jetblue the man sitting next 2 me at the terminal has a scent tht i cant quite put my finger on. pls dnt let him sit by me on the flight.
7392,Delta,"@JetBlue sadly, no! I have the app, but it also is experiencing difficulties. The flight information boards are keeping me updated."
7393,Delta,@JetBlue This is absurd. Should a stranger help my kids if there's a problem? #jetblue http://t.co/LAiGgef9Kj
7394,Delta,@JetBlue I have a disabled seat in row 6 do I get to board earlier?
7395,Delta,"@JetBlue, thanks for not guarantee that you can not deli ever my bags to my hotel, when bag missed connection. #sFO #customerservicenot"
7396,Delta,@JetBlue flight 2008
7397,Delta,@JetBlue Pittsburgh
7398,Delta,@JetBlue you're lucky we're still flying you after today's landing gear failure. Get your act together and help us sit with our kids!
7399,Delta,@JetBlue so the prefference option is not something that you honor? So why having it as one of the services if not applied?
7400,Delta,"@JetBlue if you want to be helpful, find us a seat. Don't quote terms and conditions. #jetbluefail"
7401,Delta,@JetBlue do you REALLY think it's okay to sit kids away from parents?! Srsly?! Esp after your landing gear failure?? http://t.co/x6SYW3MDVu
7402,Delta,"@JetBlue they absolutely guaranteed us we would sit with our kids. Your ""terms"" response is insulting.  #jetblue"
7403,Delta,@JetBlue flight 1025 JFK to TPA 8:05am on Saturday! One way ticket!
7404,Delta,@JetBlue What's your excuse this time for 1117 delay from LGA to TPA? I know the plane is in the air.
7405,Delta,"@JetBlue if you can't guarantee parents will sit with their children, don't sell tickets with that promise! #jetblue http://t.co/HDoXiM6NZ2"
7406,Delta,@JetBlue once you go blue you don't go back
7407,Delta,@JetBlue why are there so many delays to north east cities?
7408,Delta,@JetBlue kids fly. Don't hire people who don't care about them. This guy. #jetblue http://t.co/clvlhfgUZw
7409,Delta,@JetBlue I shouldn't be made to feel like a criminal because I want to sit near my 5 year old on a flight. #jetblue http://t.co/qgtCao1J2U
7410,Delta,"@JetBlue Usually I have such a great experience with you guys? Very, very unhappy with you right now."
7411,Delta,@JetBlue why would you hire a guy who doesn't care about the safety of children? Not remotely acceptable. http://t.co/lKFh9HYHW8
7412,Delta,"@JetBlue what's up? Three delays so far, resulting in over three hours of unnecessary, extra waiting."
7413,Delta,"@JetBlue For the record, that was less than a 10-minute turnaround time for the answer from the question.  JetBlue rocks!"
7414,Delta,@JetBlue never had an airline refuse to help sit parents with tiny kids. But this guy is willing to do it. #JetBlue http://t.co/MzZfGqfHu2
7415,Delta,"@JetBlue from San Diego with a 4 hour delay to JFK!Even you have a Amex  JetBlue, even having over 50.000 travel miles, you're still nothing"
7416,Delta,@JetBlue it seems almost inconceivable that sitting a 5 year old alone is considered okay. But this guy thinks so. http://t.co/q9n6NZYSpK
7417,Delta,@JetBlue Third straight time that my flight has been delayed flying with you guys. This will be my last trip with you.
7418,Delta,"@JetBlue you've let me down. 2:15 delay at JFK because of inbound flight from Syracuse, really? #ishouldhavedriven"
7419,Delta,@JetBlue a 5 year old can't sit alone on a flight. This is absurd. And this guy is a dick. #jetblue http://t.co/2HXsDP0ha4
7420,Delta,@JetBlue being told by this guy that he will not help us sit next to our 5 and 8 year old on the flight. #jetblue http://t.co/49FLbgzZkd
7421,Delta,@JetBlue of my tray table is broken what do i do?
7422,Delta,"@JetBlue Domestic.  To be clear -- I do not have to sit in (your lovely) terminal, just need to be there 1 hour prior to boarding?  Thanks!"
7423,Delta,@JetBlue thanks for NOT! Sending me an update that our flight was delayed 3 hours. Unbelievable!
7424,Delta,@JetBlue the fact that #ChrisHasMadeUsBLUSH isn't trending is how you know I'm loyal ;)
7425,Delta,@JetBlue 5 hours delayed now in hour increments?  Really?  &amp; as Mosaic I still have to pay $25 to use lounge during this waste of a Sunday?
7426,Delta,"@JetBlue no, I haven't done that yet. Is that something I can do online? Thx!"
7427,Delta,@JetBlue woof I'm on the red cArpet http://t.co/iIdrbLNOoX
7428,Delta,"@JetBlue @amybruni No wifi on this flight so we can't tweet you our Oscar party pics at 37,000ft. #bluecarpet :-( SEA‚úàÔ∏èBOS"
7429,Delta,@JetBlue Thank you for the reply. Would've appreciated communication before checking in about the delay. JetBlue used to be my go-to
7430,Delta,@JetBlue What confirmation number?
7431,Delta,@JetBlue You also promised to change my wife's name on the account and it is also not done.  WTF?
7432,Delta,@JetBlue You guys really suck! I just spent 40 minutes on the phone linking my credits to my account.  They are still NOT there! 1/2
7433,Delta,"@JetBlue btw, Robin Hayes is speaking at next month's @USChamber aviation summit. He ought to give a shout out to his Twitter team. You rock"
7434,Delta,@JetBlue follow for DM please
7435,Delta,@JetBlue oh. And thank you for responding
7436,Delta,@JetBlue where is it coming from? I thought Tampa?
7437,Delta,@JetBlue Good perspective. If only this safety concern had been expressed at some point before I arrived at the airport. #communicationiskey
7438,Delta,@JetBlue exactly why is my flight delayed? 599 BDL to DCA? Can't seem to get an answer
7439,Delta,@JetBlue thanks. We are ticketed on stand by for flight 1970. I hope we make it out. Fingers crossed
7440,Delta,"@JetBlue flight from BOS - RSW tomorrow, all i need is my wife + 3yr old to sit together, but no option when checking in."
7441,Delta,"@JetBlue is your partnership with Hawaiian live? Earn Hawaiian miles flying Jetblue ? IF so, how do I add @HawaiianAir to my JB Flight Booking Problems ?"
7442,Delta,@JetBlue You left 175 PEOPLE on a hot plane with no ventilation for over an hour and a half and then had to bus them to JFK because of ....
7443,Delta,@JetBlue at what point in delays can I take a different flight to my destination?
7444,Delta,@JetBlue thank you guys! You are the best! üôå‚úàÔ∏è
7445,Delta,"@JetBlue You just don't get it.  It's not about the money, It's about PEOPLE!!!! How about a public apology from the president of Jet Blue."
7446,Delta,"@JetBlue why, when you book a flight now, does jetblue separate a 3yr old from the mother? Isn't that a bit stupid? check-in headaches!"
7447,Delta,@JetBlue does not fit in 140
7448,Delta,@JetBlue love it as always!
7449,Delta,"@JetBlue You never got my wife to her destination and you expect a $75.00 ""goodwill credit"" will  make everything hunky-dory. You blew it."
7450,Delta,"@JetBlue every time I look at the flight status, 30 more minutes is added to the delay. How about some points for trouble??"
7451,Delta,"As soon as I can, sending my son home with you Saturday. @JetBlue"
7452,Delta,"@JetBlue hey awesome peeps, what's up with flight 1159 from Boston? Delayed 3hrs?"
7453,Delta,@JetBlue is there wifi on he plain
7454,Delta,"@JetBlue what a great experience on flight from SFO to JFK; seats, service, food, everything is top quality. I will be back. Very soon!"
7455,Delta,"@JetBlue Flights 1384 and 1583. I have picked up twice this week for 1583, and both times it was delayed!! üòï"
7456,Delta,"@JetBlue What's up with delays to and from Boston today? My sister is trying to go home, and bro-in-law trying to come to RDU. Craziness!"
7457,Delta,@JetBlue wondering if it's possible for my colleague and I to get on an earlier flight LAX&gt;JFK tomorrow. Can you help?
7458,Delta,@JetBlue 118 to Boston still sitting
7459,Delta,@JetBlue now we dont have enough money for parking in your garage this is your fault and im not paying for what should be 10mins into 3hrs
7460,Delta,@JetBlue hope so! looks nice and warm in San Juan üå¥
7461,Delta,@JetBlue thanks for replying-I feel a little better we'll see how it goes ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚úàÔ∏è
7462,Delta,@JetBlue I usually do-but I didn't make the Flight Booking Problems this time-that'll teach me! Yea I have that going for me at least haha
7463,Delta,@JetBlue I waited 3 hrs for my bags and my flight was only 2 hrs
7464,Delta,@JetBlue should I bother contacting them? I already checked into my flight üòï
7465,Delta,@JetBlue early last month via Expedia-there's an extra middle name and initial attached to my last name
7466,Delta,"@JetBlue backlog is an hour at most, this is over two!  Unacceptable!!"
7467,Delta,@JetBlue your agent told us TSA didn't have a crew to get bags!
7468,Delta,@JetBlue you guys rock!
7469,Delta,@JetBlue my email is my twitter handle followed by gmail ‚ò∫üëçüëç
7470,Delta,@JetBlue Awesome! #bestairlineever
7471,Delta,@JetBlue no baggage crew update!  Your staff is incompetent with no answers after 2 hours....
7472,Delta,@JetBlue the whole plane. Flight 561 from LGA to PBI http://t.co/4Ktk2hsmGy
7473,Delta,@JetBlue is blaming @TSA for flight 584 luggage debacle!  #luggagegate
7474,Delta,"@JetBlue Yoga it is. TV service seems to be down though :-(
I look forward to that do much!"
7475,Delta,"@JetBlue w/ edits: Dear @msbgu , your MBAs need better benefits. They should work for us. How can we meet them?"
7476,Delta,@JetBlue of course I am!!‚úàÔ∏è
7477,Delta,@JetBlue You failed. That's the answer. Please don't justify otherwise.
7478,Delta,"@JetBlue come on! Already delayed 2+ hrs on flight 1415 as we waited for the pilot to come from Boston, now you reassign him?! Endless trip."
7479,Delta,"@JetBlue When I got your alert, I immediately started looking to rebook. But we only had 11 minutes from reFlight Booking Problems to catch a flight to SRQ."
7480,Delta,@JetBlue I only fly Jet Blue
7481,Delta,@JetBlue Perhaps you need to start recruiting @msbgu ;)
7482,Delta,@JetBlue Start including PTO in your getaway packages and I'm all in
7483,Delta,@JetBlue thanks. I will use the extra time to do some more shopping! Did somebody say duty free?
7484,Delta,@JetBlue's flight Flight Booking Problems experience is pretty great!
7485,Delta,@JetBlue still waiting to board and see if they will give us the exit row.
7486,Delta,@JetBlue thanks for making my trip home #MintyFresh next #brandmance flight I'll take more selfies! #LOVE #travel #business
7487,Delta,"@JetBlue  I shouldn't have to find them, they should tell us. I've flown Jet Blue since your first month. The experience isn't what it was."
7488,Delta,@JetBlue if my flight was delayed can I show up at the airport with the appropriate amount of time for the delay or do I have to go on time?
7489,Delta,@JetBlue I'm over that honestly just would like to get going on the journey.
7490,Delta,"@JetBlue If that was the case, why did your alert arrive so Late Flight? Four-hour delay? Don't buy it."
7491,Delta,@JetBlue our flight out no Tv. Now our flight back not seated together. B6 620. Maybe our fault still no fun.
7492,Delta,@JetBlue I don't believe so. That's not what the team has told us.
7493,Delta,@JetBlue also not have food available even for purchase is quite shocking since this is a 5 hour international flight.
7494,Delta,@JetBlue #1691 out of JFK. no one has info &amp; no answers as to why we boarded the plane. the team is in an awkward spot &amp; everyone is cranky
7495,Delta,@JetBlue I have a reservation for tomorrow morning but trying to get back 2 night bc other flight was going to jfk. Can I get on list at CTG
7496,Delta,@jetblue  Flight 1562 is still waiting for bags. Most of us checked in 12 hours ago. People are missing connections.  Please help!
7497,Delta,@JetBlue any way to get 2 ppl on standby list for flight 1970 FLL to BOS. Trying to find way home.
7498,Delta,@JetBlue Something to think about when you are dealing with PEOPLE!!!!!  Just wrong.  No excuses. Figure it out &amp; expect the unexpected
7499,Delta,@JetBlue I understand but wish you would have announced the delay 2 hours earlier vs sitting for 2 hrs at MCO
7500,Delta,@JetBlue what gives? Delayed over 2 hours at MCO to JFK. Every time!
7501,Delta,"‚Äú@JetBlue: @2littlebirds Well captured, Brittany! We love the clouds! :)  Enjoy the ride!‚Äù Thank you!"
7502,Delta,@JetBlue My wife was with our dog.  They wouldn't even let her out off the plane.  My daughter was at Newburgh lives close by. So wrong
7503,Delta,"@JetBlue According to your ground staff, it hasn't even been taken off the plane yet!"
7504,Delta,.@JetBlue thanks for making an effort. Credit where credit is due: flight 795 delayed 5 hours instead of 8 hours. #fwiw #loweredexpectations
7505,Delta,@JetBlue At what time?  All these passengers were sitting on a hot plane with no air and no communication for over 2 hours. Just wrong
7506,Delta,"@JetBlue flight delayed at JFK 2 hours, then 3 hours, then 8.5 hours? Now it's back to 5 hours with no explanation or apology?"
7507,Delta,@JetBlue thanks! Have a good Sunday.
7508,Delta,"@JetBlue Flight 1562 had a 4 1/2 hour weather delay, but what is the 45 minute delay in getting bags to tired passengers?"
7509,Delta,@JetBlue 5hrs on Tarmac yest b4 Cancelled Flight @12am.Today 3+ hr delay. Why not send txt/email re: JFK closed &amp; saved all trip 2 sit @airport again?
7510,Delta,"@JetBlue flying out of BUF 2 BOS, missing captain... Really? Delayed til 2:00... Not happy..."
7511,Delta,"@jetblue, it would be nice if the app would actually inform you that a flight is delayed."
7512,Delta,His name is Enzo üòä RT @JetBlue : @Setorii Well hello there pooch! What's your name? #dog http://t.co/dLh9138HBg
7513,Delta,"@JetBlue I know, but I wanted to pass it along. Not good for the ""T5 experience"" esp for someone who flies 2-3 times a month."
7514,Delta,@JetBlue Flight 136 departed Phoenix at 1:30 am
7515,Delta,@JetBlue So what about the plane stuck in Newburgh won't start.  It that weather reLate Flightd as well.  These passengers on plane for 10 hrs.
7516,Delta,@JetBlue thanks. Home to MSY. TSA precheck agents directing people after photo until scan beyond rude. One grabbed and pushed children.
7517,Delta,@JetBlue Promo Watch Phone $33 at Amazon check http://t.co/leNaOwFyvU

7519,Delta,@JetBlue Customer of the year? http://t.co/epqqONHO2H
7520,Delta,"@JetBlue JFK T5 north check in. 3 bag drop ladies, 1 has been checking in someone for the entire time; another doing check ins too."
7521,Delta,@JetBlue no excuse though for 3 gate changes though.
7522,Delta,"@JetBlue if someone had bothered to inform us that the airport closed, that would have helped."
7523,Delta,@JetBlue get me home! Flight 2016 from buf to Bos is missing a captain!? Really!?
7524,Delta,@JetBlue nope. This 8:45am flight is now not leaving until almost 5pm. 5! I can't believe I paid money for this.
7525,Delta,@JetBlue thank you. We are finally at the gate.
7526,Delta,@JetBlue flight to Orlando is unable to serve hot bevies.... So they've made movies and alcohol complimentary. That works
7527,Delta,@JetBlue @CookJaycook123 the only update we get is that they have no idea when we will get an update. Way to go. #hopeless
7528,Delta,@JetBlue @Amagrino will you cover the cost of my car service waiting time?!
7529,Delta,@JetBlue don't I always?
7530,Delta,@JetBlue Landing! As usual great flight wiyh a great crew. Hello sunny West Palm Beach ! #jetbluerocks
7531,Delta,"@JetBlue this is ridiculous we are on 1.5 hours coming up of waiting to deplane, there are are newborns on board"
7532,Delta,"@JetBlue waiting at HPN on plane more than an hour since landing b/c of no gate, please get us off this plane!"
7533,Delta,@JetBlue too Late Flight. Several passengers are inebriated. You're in league with big alcohol. Shame on you.
7534,Delta,@JetBlue thanks for making my vacation not worth it again... Currently waiting on the runway for another hour to DEPLANE
7535,Delta,@JetBlue letting me down in San Fran. No Media rate? What's the deal? Looks like this is the last time I fly anywhere with you.
7536,Delta,@JetBlue they were amazing and thank you!
7537,Delta,"@JetBlue and have empty ""help"" desks"
7538,Delta,"@JetBlue there was a closure? People here need to inform passengers, not send them gate to gate w no info on boards re: updated departures"
7539,Delta,@JetBlue according to jfk plenty of planes are landing. No problem there
7540,Delta,@JetBlue when will the system be up and running?
7541,Delta,@JetBlue Thanks for the THIRD gate change http://t.co/UfBdr5AxeO
7542,Delta,‚Äú@JetBlue: @2littlebirds Beautiful shot.. Thanks for sharing. Using #FlyFi to post? ;)‚Äù Your welcome! Not on this flight. It was a quickie;)
7543,Delta,@JetBlue Flight 1533 JFK to Cartagena all at this airport bar singing the opposite of your praises! We're making a pact to never fly u again
7544,Delta,@JetBlue 795 to Austin
7545,Delta,"@JetBlue she helped me with my problem so easily and was so nice, you guys rock!"
7546,Delta,@JetBlue what happened to our plane meant to leave @ 830? Why do we have to wait for 1 from buffalo? Seems organizational error not weather.
7547,Delta,"@JetBlue where is the ""award winning service""?"
7548,Delta,@JetBlue really not acceptable. Just informed plane won't start. Chartering bus to take passengers to jfk.
7549,Delta,@JetBlue how much longer to JFK open's I am a diabetic and I need sugar plane don't have nothing
7550,Delta,@JetBlue flight 16 now sent back to the gate even though the app says its leaving. Anyone have a clue? It's 36 and sunny at JFK
7551,Delta,@JetBlue u guys have 2b kidding. No help anywhere. 5 hour delays? Still no answers. Bad cust service. #idlovetoask http://t.co/DPX3yoGTEj
7552,Delta,@JetBlue they are now being sent off the plane? Does anyone at JetBlue have a clue?
7553,Delta,"@JetBlue unfortunately I was so startled and rushed, I didn't get the name, but will provide a description in my expanded email.  Thank you"
7554,Delta,@JetBlue your customer service agent Bonnie is amazing on the phone she deserves a promotion!!!
7555,Delta,@JetBlue just a very rude rep while trying to book family vacation using trvl credit. on phone w/ new rep now who is being very helpful
7556,Delta,@JetBlue BOS. Everything current now. Thanks for the follow up
7557,Delta,@JetBlue it's sunny and gorgeous in ny actually. What's the real reason?
7558,Delta,@JetBlue thanks for the info. Already doing it now before we board! Looking forward to the future upgrades! #JetBlue http://t.co/5Db9eSBNzG
7559,Delta,@JetBlue things happen it's ok just wish I was on the beach and not in the airport
7560,Delta,"@JetBlue it's been 3 hours, why have you not sent the plane from the hangar for flight 1533 at JFK? This is absolutely ridiculous."
7561,Delta,@JetBlue any idea when the flight will actually take off?
7562,Delta,@JetBlue I love #JetBlue ! #FlyFi when will we be able to charge our devices on domestic #A320 flights?! Thanks! http://t.co/obqIro1bUJ
7563,Delta,@JetBlue still sitting in plane in Newburg. This is getting #ridiculous. No way to treat #loyal customers.
7564,Delta,@JetBlue Touchdown JFK! Well done pilots of JetBlue Flight 226! #JetBlueRocks
7565,Delta,@JetBlue what's the delay if the system isn't down?
7566,Delta,@JetBlue  Not blaming Jet Blue.  This wasn't weather. Can't have planes in the air and runways a mess. That's a disaster waiting to happen.
7567,Delta,@JetBlue don't think any1 rly knows what's goin on. supposed 2 leave at 8:30a then 9a then 9:30a then 10a then 11a then 11:30a. Now 12
7568,Delta,@JetBlue That is not very gracious of @jetblue to tell me where I can go BUY water or a snack when our flight is delayed over 3 hours.
7569,Delta,@JetBlue and ask she load the bag for my flight
7570,Delta,"@JetBlue after applying my new tag, she left my bag on the ground rather than loading on the conveyer belt..I had to walk back 50 yards"
7571,Delta,@JetBlue get flight 16 into the air
7572,Delta,@JetBlue That's not weather reLate Flightd.  You are just being nice and blaming the weather.  Airport just wasn't prepared. Investigation time.
7573,Delta,"@JetBlue if I had my tux, it'd be a date! #UMosaicMeCrazy http://t.co/hap4gboSTU"
7574,Delta,@JetBlue Thanks for the personalized customer service! #cannedtweet #autoresponse
7575,Delta,"@JetBlue then this agent demanded I remove my old luggage tag, every other airport the JB agent politely handles it"
7576,Delta,@JetBlue I'm also a mosaic customer and fly jet blue ALOT....
7577,Delta,@JetBlue It's not so much the delays as the fact that the flight is still coming up as on time on your app. Just give us an honest estimate
7578,Delta,@JetBlue she waved someone behind me to step forward although I explained what happened and indicated my need to make my flight
7579,Delta,@JetBlue #489. Flight #589 is departing before we even board
7580,Delta,@JetBlue I knew there was a reason u were my favorite airline. Just read you answer on twitter in globe this morning. Great job
7581,Delta,"@JetBlue here's part: was at bag drop inserted my JetBlue cc, didn't print pass. Agent standing in front of me refused to print my pass"
7582,Delta,@JetBlue it's only because I'm wearing #TrueBlueColors!
7583,Delta,@JetBlue flight16?
7584,Delta,@JetBlue That's not what I heard. Weather was fine this morning. Flight 136 was circling for some time.Someone forgot to clean the runway.
7585,Delta,"@JetBlue When it's 30 mins past scheduled time w/ no departure in sight a flight no longer qualifies as ""on time"" #updateyourwebsite #489"
7586,Delta,@JetBlue whatever your lil #mint heart desires! http://t.co/WmX12F33ZC
7587,Delta,@JetBlue how can your entire system go down? No IT? Really?
7588,Delta,@JetBlue Appreciate the heads up at 10:45 that my 11am flight was delayed bc the crew is stuck in Boston #communicationFAIL #dobetterJetBlue
7589,Delta,@JetBlue seriously? System down? No IT?
7590,Delta,"@JetBlue yup we know, not your fault, just not ideal sittin for over an hour but as always your staff is great!"
7591,Delta,"@JetBlue just had a horrible experience with check in agent at fort myers, I'll document and send details, off to Boston"
7592,Delta,"@JetBlue flt1533 to Carta what is goin on?! 1st told plane coming from hangar, then gate change, now no one knows wat plane we're getting on"
7593,Delta,@JetBlue have a cpap machine for sleep apnea. Is this OK to carry on if I also have a small bag for clothes?
7594,Delta,@JetBlue got it. thanks the quick reply.
7595,Delta,@JetBlue isn't this something YOU should do?!  Why should I tell your crew how to do their job?
7596,Delta,@JetBlue your app needs updating. Says my flight is on time when we are well past boarding time with 2hr delay http://t.co/BTvpxTZJu0
7597,Delta,@JetBlue do bags still fly free or have you started charging? thanks!
7598,Delta,@JetBlue had a great experience working with Glenn Coles at Buffalo-Niagara Airport!! Top notch employee
7599,Delta,"@JetBlue well, the last update was in the right direction, at least! I'll keep my fingers crossed."

7601,Delta,"@JetBlue thx, social media person!"

7603,Delta,@JetBlue Just left #LaGuardia now...#Sunshine in a little over 2 hours
7604,Delta,"@JetBlue I hear you and safety is #1! I think we can get to JFK though now so let's help the pilots, passengers &amp; crew get there safely!"
7605,Delta,"@JetBlue is JFK still closed? Tryna get out of Ft Lauderdale on flight 502, just want to get home to nyc!"
7606,Delta,@JetBlue woulda been nice of you to let us know that or post it!!! Your boards still show the flight on time!!!
7607,Delta,"@JetBlue  hmmm it says im following you. We just got de-iced, but still haning around for the runway to clear.."

7616,Delta,What can I say other than when it comes to my #BrandLoveAffair w/ @jetblue ur my #soulandinspiration https://t.co/IGkoGyWksr #umosaicmecrazy
7617,Delta,"@JetBlue Issue is JFK. Pilot explained once JFK reopens we can get scheduled back there, but why can't we divert to LGA? Closer than ACY!"
7618,Delta,@JetBlue you want me to talk to the wall?
7619,Delta,@JetBlue Great service from PBI to HPN! Thanks.
7620,Delta,@JetBlue Its poor Flight management. There is   no reason why a scheduled 8:00  pm  flight to takr off At 11:00pm .
7621,Delta,@JetBlue hi is there a way we can check to track the flight that will arrive &amp; that will be our flight to depart.
7622,Delta,"@JetBlue done, thank you!"
7623,Delta,@JetBlue note the time this was taken (now at 906 am) and flight still listed as on time for 910 when I'm not onboard http://t.co/zvfmxnuELJ
7624,Delta,@JetBlue  will do.
7625,Delta,@JetBlue why is my 910 flight listed on time when its 904AM and I'm not on the plane yet? http://t.co/iEG2ObcEpp

7633,Delta,@JetBlue @fllairport best way to kill nine hours at the airport when all flights are full and the airline won't put you standby? #stranded
7634,Delta,"@JetBlue yes, they said the runway isn't ready and they're waiting for port authority to remove the snow and they are no where in sight."
7635,Delta,"@JetBlue I travel for business twice a week and after the @AmericanAir fiasco, I'll be flying blue more often. Thanks."
7636,Delta,@JetBlue we are on flight 751 and were returning to the gate can you provide any information?
7637,Delta,@JetBlue won't see my money again after their poor service    should have stuck with virgin america what was i thinking trying jetblue???
7638,Delta,@JetBlue suck and their customer services are the worst  whats the point of having a loyalty scheme that they don't honor #badairline
7639,Delta,@JetBlue  I see my flight from Boston to Pitts is ok from this afternoon. Did you have any delays for the morning flight?
7640,Delta,"@JetBlue  FLL to MDE, great flight, great customer service, THANKS! 2 mths waiting  @AmericanAir  to speak to a human at customer service"
7641,Delta,@JetBlue how about an update on flight 475 leaving tf green delayed
7642,Delta,@JetBlue well they said Cancelled Flight on the PA system. Guess they are trying to get a plane from Boston. And not a 100%  confirmed
7643,Delta,@JetBlue that's where we all get on the same page. Cancelled Flighted it 45 mins ago. @delta @SouthwestAir help flights from @tfgreenairport to MCO?

7646,Delta,@JetBlue okay thank you! I'll check with them again!
7647,Delta,@JetBlue some woman stole my seat on the plane but I was the one that had to sit elsewhere. Is that standard protocol?

7650,Delta,@JetBlue Thanks! See you soon!
7651,Delta,"@JetBlue Yep, still waiting for bags at #JFK. What's the holdup? Looks like we are the only flight that got in at this time..??"
7652,Delta,@JetBlue thanks for getting us to NYC -JFK really safely. :-) But srsly? How long does it take to get our checked bags? #eternity #5amMisery
7653,Delta,@JetBlue should I expect delays at dca for 7am departure?  Going to Orlando on flight 723
7654,Delta,@JetBlue full the six of us had to leave flight. And now have to wait a whole day to get a flight and my kids will miss school.
7655,Delta,@JetBlue no. Not boarding order. Someone boarded with. Service Animal which a member of my party was allergic to and because the flight was
7656,Delta,@JetBlue it's ridiculous that I just got home and I was supposed to land 3 hours ago bc I am HELLA tired
7657,Delta,@JetBlue just lost very loyal customers who use them 4-10 times a year.
7658,Delta,@JetBlue thanks for the response - when is the next flight after the 9:48 flight?
7659,Delta,@JetBlue Highlight of my travel is 3 hour delay and de-icing twice. Now sitting in bumper to bumper traffic in taxi to finally get home. üòí
7660,Delta,@JetBlue great flight on a brand new jet. Great seating. Beautiful plane. Big fan of this airline.
7661,Delta,@JetBlue a voucher.. I can't believe I took this risk. Not only was the plane terribly filthy and I had 15 screaming babies in my face..
7662,Delta,@JetBlue @SouthwestAir @VirginAmerica @AmericanAirBR download jeokoo the American app for air travelers
7663,Delta,@JetBlue thank you! I know the weather in #Boston isn't great. Everyone's tired
7664,Delta,@JetBlue I've spoken 2/emailed JB team and explained situation. Didnt seem to matter to anyone other than me. I guess I just expected more.
7665,Delta,@JetBlue  Alright I hope. My JetBlue app is showing a change in my seats and online shows an a320.  Don't want any surprises
7666,Delta,@JetBlue I know you guys are super busy but is flight 1222 an a320 or e190?
7667,Delta,@JetBlue Follow me pls?
7668,Delta,@JetBlue Shocked by misbehavior and cheap comments from jet airways staff to passenger at Delhi Airport Friday boarding to Dubai. Disgusting
7669,Delta,@JetBlue you have to service your remote controllers on my flight I watched equalizer (movie) THREE times because my remote was stuck
7670,Delta,@JetBlue @dgruber1700  oh wow and I'm complaining about two hour on the run way shucks JetBlue NOT GOOD your service was better than this

7672,Delta,@JetBlue thank you thank you!  I finally set up the jetblue app!  Yay!
7673,Delta,@JetBlue everytime I come back to Boston it's a minimum 45 min wait for bags. Earlier it was almost an hour. Why is it only Boston jetblue?
7674,Delta,@JetBlue Thanks for taking me back home today despite Pandora's best efforts to Cancelled Flight the flight. #jetblue #backhome #noplacelikehome

7711,Delta,@JetBlue we got our luggage after waiting 40 mins and went home right after. Not very family and ADA friendly waiting that long w no chairs.

8188,Delta,"@JetBlue sorry for my misunderstanding of the term, but what does that exactly mean?"
8189,Delta,@JetBlue why do you have every channel but @ABCNetwork How are @kgonzales89 and I supposed to watch Scandal? But free FlyFi is sweet!

8191,Delta,@JetBlue What is going on with the flight from Buffalo to JFK? Have they figured anything out about the temperature and the tower yet?
8192,Delta,@jetblue we never received that $15 credit for inoperable tv's on our SFO &gt; JFK flight 2 weeks ago. never got an email...
8193,Delta,"@JetBlue, was far less painful than what was coming from Avis.  üíô"

8200,Delta,@JetBlue the pilot just stated that after 22 years of flying he has never experienced anything like this. #gettingoffplane
8201,Delta,@JetBlue we now have to get off of the plane and wait another 1-2 hours for someone at the @BuffaloAirport to read the temp. #tired

8205,Delta,@JetBlue I appreciate the quick response but how can no one go outside to check temp so we can leave in BUF #currentlysittingontarmac
8206,Delta,@JetBlue after 40 mins they tell us they can't check temperature for at least 2 more hours. So it's back to the gate to wait. #mosiacfail
8207,Delta,@JetBlue in the sky on flight 833 from BOS to SFO. Awesome crew! Helene rocks!

8220,Delta,@JetBlue Thank you. I really would have preferred Jet Blue. You guys have the best seats in the business.
8221,Delta,@JetBlue Hi. I'm trying to find a flight to the Middle East.
8222,Delta,@JetBlue @lopezlaymari what a patronizing response to a legitimate issue
8223,Delta,@JetBlue Yep. 1 hour at Logan. Gangway broke and cabin crew stuck on plane. They just arrived. Passengers request butt massages.
8224,Delta,@JetBlue I love your flights! But theres always some delay unfortunately
8225,Delta,"@JetBlue yes thankfully! Catering just got here and now they are loading, but very frustrated. I was supposed to be there by 10-10:30"
8226,Delta,@JetBlue my butt hurts.
8227,Delta,@JetBlue that's what they told me half an hour ago
8228,Delta,@JetBlue I have been hanging here for almost an hour
8229,Delta,"@JetBlue took forever for catering to get to my flight, now are very delayed. So ticked off right now."
8230,Delta,@JetBlue it is absurd that I have waited more than 45mins because the flight attendant assigned for my flight is Late Flight. You dont have others?
8231,Delta,@JetBlue safety first !! #lovejetblue
8232,Delta,@JetBlue delayed flight bummer
8233,Delta,@JetBlue here in Austin I saw the water bottles &amp; snacks @ the desk for your waiting passengers! Im so Flight Booking Problems my next flight with you!
8234,Delta,"@JetBlue no, they're too busy being awesome and trying to get us out ASAP. I'll deal."
8235,Delta,"@jetblue well, we're on our way now, but more than half my tv channels are just static. üòî"

8245,Delta,"@JetBlue Although it wasn't totally the answer I was looking for, I appreciate the prompt response."
8246,Delta,@JetBlue Guess I'll wait another 24 hrs in hopes rate goes down &amp; is more reasonable. Fingers crossed. Cutting it close to my travel dates.
8247,Delta,@JetBlue do you do any discounts for volunteer firefighters?
8248,Delta,"@JetBlue Well, I fly into Huntsville, AL. But I'd take either Nashville or Birmingham too!"
8249,Delta,"@JetBlue If your confirming to me that the rate won't go down again looks like I can't fly JetBlue this time around, can't afford that price"
8250,Delta,@JetBlue :/ he was trying to take stuff from the under the seat in front of him and bugging out throughout the flight. Didn't feel safe.
8251,Delta,@JetBlue oh yes! I hope you expand to other airports soon so I can fly you to see my family each year!!!!
8252,Delta,@JetBlue Been a member since 2007. Looking to travel next week 2/24-2/27. Couldn't book right away due to all the snow; I'm in BOS.

8254,Delta,"@JetBlue but thank you! Love, an anxious flyer."
8255,Delta,@JetBlue Same exact flight too. Love JetBlue. Really want to fly with ya'll. But that's a little pricey for basic (not Mint). BOS to SFO.
8256,Delta,@JetBlue I don't want to seem crazy! Have already asked twice!
8257,Delta,@JetBlue Flight I want to book was $320 one day; went to purchase next day &amp; price doubled to $737. Inquiring on chance it may go down?
8258,Delta,"@JetBlue Sent an email more than 24 hours ago asking a few questions, still no response. Need answers before (hopefully) Flight Booking Problems flight..."
8259,Delta,@JetBlue all they said was delayed due to mechanical issues. I'm looking for something a little more specific.
8260,Delta,"@JetBlue if I'm about to get on a plane, I think I deserve to know what the mechanical issues are for the flight being delayed."
8261,Delta,@JetBlue can you give me an update on flight 1684 MCO-&gt;JFK? They're saying mechanical issues but will not disclose what they are...

8272,Delta,@JetBlue That'd be nice! Hoping to rack up enough miles to take a trip to Seattle and enjoy a perfect latte in the city of coffee.

8279,Delta,"@JetBlue quick question, to pay for a second bag, do I have to do it online or can I do it at the airport?"
8280,Delta,"@JetBlue not cool to announce a flight ""delay"" when everyone is checking in. A 4 hour delay bdl-dca with a staff offering  no help."
8281,Delta,@JetBlue Hi. How do I claim points on a 1800-flowers order after I purchased? I totally forgot to put in the promo code.
8282,Delta,@JetBlue what's the hold up with flight 1553? boarding should've taken place 30 minutes ago.
8283,Delta,@JetBlue yes slc on 4/19
8284,Delta,@JetBlue now we are waiting over an half hr for the packages. What's wrong with you guys?? http://t.co/wVGpp3Ymz1
8285,Delta,@jetblue How long ago can a trip have taken place for me to still get credit if I didn't apply my TrueBlue # when I booked?
8286,Delta,@JetBlue thanks for your help! #jetbluesofly
8287,Delta,@jetblue I was able to access it by using the drop down instead of clicking on the tab.
8288,Delta,@JetBlue Do your TrueBlue pages not work on Chrome or Safari? I keep getting blank pages when I lick on the TrueBlue tab on your site.
8289,Delta,"@JetBlue:  Ahoy from a loyal #AllYouCanJetPass holder! When do you anticipate direct US flights to #Havana, #Cuba? (#JetBlue #Vacation)"
8290,Delta,@JetBlue that is my point! They are only offering me a flight the next day and expect me to now pay for a hotel because they Cancelled Flightled.
8291,Delta,@JetBlue excited for my first flight w/ you today! It's delayed though- can you give me the 411? Flight number 989 from Boston to DC
8292,Delta,@JetBlue what is the Mosiac 800 #?
8293,Delta,@JetBlue I can probably find some of them. Are the ticket #s on there?
8294,Delta,"@JetBlue no they offered the flight (4/19), I paid, then they changed it.This is the 2nd  time you have done this to me. ruins cruise plans"
8295,Delta,"@JetBlue okie doke! Knowing you, you will fix this ;)"
8296,Delta,@JetBlue should I check in my awesome bag on my flight or carry it on... Decisions...
8297,Delta,@JetBlue I can't. I don't have acces to a phone rn. My iPhone broke. :/ would rather change it now then Late Flightr.
8298,Delta,@JetBlue I can't do that flight. I need a Late Flightr one! I need you to change my flight. You guys changed it and now I can't do that time!

8315,Delta,"@JetBlue I want to add, my flight to Mexico was on Air Canada. Same exact situation, but with none of the problems I've had with Jet Blue."
8316,Delta,@JetBlue You mean take more of my time to write you a physical letter because the fraud department doesn't have email or telephones. Right?
8317,Delta,@JetBlue Capital One and I explained the false fraud alert. Why did the Jet Blue representative issue me a new tkt if it wasn't resolved?

8323,Delta,"@JetBlue I called jet blue to get an explanation, and make sure it would not happen in the future. I was told to write the fraud dept."

9096,US Airways,@USAirways they have all of this at hotels. Still don't have my work folder or business casual clothes. #worst http://t.co/JIEYCat1Ek
9097,US Airways,@USAirways oh I got right through to an agent. They just kept putting me on hold and still didn't fix the problem
9098,US Airways,@USAirways There is no reFlight Booking Problems the event I'm flying to attend. Waiting for jetway driver??? STILL ON TARMAC???
9099,US Airways,@USAirways Baggage Team? Recording tells me my bag still hasn't been found. And delayed baggage link on web conveniently not working. #worst
9100,US Airways,@USAirways been trying for weeks no use
9101,US Airways,@USAirways should give me free baggage for this mess
9102,US Airways,"@USAirways Gate traffic #DCA, MY flight arrived 20 early,connecting flight 2139 leaving in 23 minutes. Several of us stuck. HOLD THAT PLANE."
9103,US Airways,@USAirways I really feel like your company needs evaluate their policies &amp; realize that transfers should be possible for tickets
9104,US Airways,@USAirways I know this is probably a no but is there a way to get a cheaper airfare ticket if the flight is leaving in a few hours? üôè
9105,US Airways,@USAirways seriously???  did you not see that I've spent 2 days - for multiple hours on hold just to have to hang up after the hours?
9106,US Airways,"@USAirways Waiting on my flight right now, thanks!!"
9107,US Airways,@USAirways How do I add my TSA Pre number to an existing reservation?
9108,US Airways,@USAirways can i please have someone call me 781 879 4505
9109,US Airways,@USAirways We're back at a gate. Opposite of wheels up. Im sure we'll get thete eventually. So thanks.
9110,US Airways,@USAirways. R U aware your wait time to talk to a sales agent is always 30-60 minutes? Unacceptable. At least employ a call back feature!
9111,US Airways,@USAirways &amp; @AmericanAir: 1 flight Cancelled Flightled yesterday and now a delay today has robbed my daughter of 2 days with her grandparents. Thanks
9112,US Airways,@USAirways 1729 connecting in charlotte to houston. Mechanical issue determined while q'd to take off. And we checked our bags.
9113,US Airways,@USAirways can you DM please in regards to update on lost bag please.
9114,US Airways,@USAirways need to retrain US 3837 lead flight attendant and gate agent at arrival MKE 2/23.  Horrible attitudes toward helping customers.
9115,US Airways,@USAirways Youre batting .1000. Every flight Ive taken is delayed. Worst airline. ever.
9116,US Airways,@USAirways knows customer service!! Thank you for starting our 2 week vacay on an amazing note! Thank you sarita!!!
9117,US Airways,@USAirways why aren't you updating flight status/delays?
9118,US Airways,@USAirways They're also saying the CLT flights are delayed but you're not showing it in your system which makes it impossible to figure out
9119,US Airways,"@USAirways nope, they just announced we're headed back to the gate."
9120,US Airways,@USAirways pretty sure we didn't actually take off at 7:10 http://t.co/vuxf4r4Unu
9121,US Airways,@USAirways well then that is a horrible flaw in your system. 2 hours in the past day I've wasted. I've got a job &amp; family this is crazy
9122,US Airways,@USAirways 5203 and we're just sitting 20 feet from an open gate
9123,US Airways,@USAirways just wasted another hour of my life on hold. this is insanity. there has to be another way to use my voucher as payment online
9124,US Airways,@USAirways what's wrong with the plane? Flt 581
9125,US Airways,"@USAirways @united two broken airplanes, two days Late Flightr and I'm stranded after a funeral and missing out on my last semester of #college. üëç"
9126,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir Day 3 &amp; still no luggage Chkd http://t.co/MbLTALr4BS STATUS=AWAITING ASGMNT TO DRIVER Since yest 10:15am
9127,US Airways,@USAirways Flight 830 CLT to Phl. I was 1st on list.Someone else got spot. Rude employee in coach. Wouldt give ID. Said he was cute red head
9128,US Airways,"@USAirways asked her why needed to take yellow tag off. She said, ""because I told you to!"" Expect a personal apology from her- unacceptable!"
9129,US Airways,"@USAirways , since jan 22 have been on 10 flights. Why the disrespect in CLT, flt #2063 at 2:50pm on 18feb to DCA? just asked herba question"
9130,US Airways,@USAirways nah it's for my flight next week.. inside my Chairman 7-day window but you still haven't released the last open First seat to me
9131,US Airways,@USAirways flight 1946 out of clt this morning.  It's snowing here.  Should i head out to the airport?
9132,US Airways,@USAirways I've been on hold for 41min. Just trying to change my reservation.
9133,US Airways,@USAirways I am a UK citizen. Is there a UK number I could try?
9134,US Airways,@USAirways I just spent 3.5 hours and got nowhere. Entire experience #epicfail
9135,US Airways,@USAirways Changing my flights with no explanations and still don't have a confirmation. So disappointed in the service
9136,US Airways,@USAirways nope not yet...
9137,US Airways,@usairways I will make sure to never use your incompetent airlines again. My luggage has been out for delivery for 24 hours.
9138,US Airways,"@usairways My flight was Cancelled Flighted Saturday. Why was my luggage not at the airport? Today, I'm supposed to have it delivered. Pathetic"
9139,US Airways,@usairways  Thank you for allowing me to spend more money on vacation by buying things I already bought.
9140,US Airways,@usairways Thanks so much for ruining my vacation. I really couldn't have done it without you.
9141,US Airways,@USAirways it's not like I'm trying to leave earlier just for fun. I don't want to get stuck in DC if we have bad weather in RDU.
9142,US Airways,@USAirways some flexibility on your part would be nice. This is why I love @SouthwestAir. They're flexible &amp; not trying to take all my $.
9143,US Airways,@USAirways Excited that I'll be flying from Syracuse to interview in Dallas on Friday for the FA position- this is a goal &amp; dream of mine!
9144,US Airways,@USAirways thank you for reaching out to me. Hopefully my request will be fixed and I can remain a loyal customer.
9145,US Airways,@USAirways it doesn't take 6 days to respond to an already open case!
9146,US Airways,"@usairways great crew for flight 504 PHX to YVR tonight! Friendly, efficient. Awesome job."
9147,US Airways,@USAirways are people going to answer our calls?
9148,US Airways,@USAirways pilot forgets to show up to work and Ricky J (gate agent) gives customers attitude. #usairwaysfail
9149,US Airways,@USAirways : You Make the Reservation; We'll Make the Excuses! #usairwaysfail
9150,US Airways,@USAirways Thank You for your empathy there is more to this story than just the luggage but thank you for reaching out
9151,US Airways,@USAirways is utterly unreliable! They didn't schedule a pilot for their US624 flight out of Seattle - flights are delayed #usairwaysfail
9152,US Airways,@USAirways yes but again valuable time has been lost
9153,US Airways,@USAirways I don't like being lied to. No bad weather in dc md va. I've been stuck in CA all day and should've been home by now. You owe me.
9154,US Airways,@USAirways yes it landed at 11:40am. Should not take another 12+ hours to go 40 min drive. Was assured I would have this am.
9155,US Airways,@USAirways the disappointment was not the bag but that it arrived before me and I was kept 12 hrs without options in IAH
9156,US Airways,@USAirways can't get back lost time
9157,US Airways,@USAirways flt 1820 2rsw could have extended the courtsey of waiting 2min 4 10 of us.... gates closed in r faces.  Ur fired
9158,US Airways,@USAirways - thanks however I feel like the system has failed me -- what is the solution?
9159,US Airways,@USAirways my bag landed 1 day Late Flight at sfo at 11:40am. How can it be 10:01pm and I still don't have it? Flight 719 2/22/14
9160,US Airways,@USAirways thanks very much! I got thru on the phone &amp; everything is fine. Just love the website &amp; app ! Thanks for working on it!
9161,US Airways,"@USAirways thanks for nothing. Bought two tix through you to Disney and my friend can't go and now I have to eat the 400, plus 600 for new 1"
9162,US Airways,@USAirways Hi. I'm in LGA but my luggage is in CLT. Have been told to come back tomorrow to collect. Do you guys want to cover my taxi fare?
9163,US Airways,"@USAirways  Instead of fair treatment, I got a nasty letter from a lady in senior management that illness forfeits miles like death."
9164,US Airways,"@USAirways  A few years ago I lost over 50,000 miles bc I was physically unable to fly during the period.  I submitted a doctor's note."
9165,US Airways,@USAirways  I've never been treated this badly
9166,US Airways,@USAirways  I'm glad this airline is going to be swallowed by American!!! American always picks up the phone and solves problems.
9167,US Airways,@USAirways  Three months and my miles haven't been credited.  No one is going to read the email I sent.
9168,US Airways,@USAirways   My email gets me a canned response that it takes 10 days for mileage to get credited --- It's been three months and my miles
9169,US Airways,@USAirways  My tweet gets me a response to email dmsc@usairways.com
9170,US Airways,@USAirways The help/complaint forms on the website can be used only if the matter applies to an actual ticketed flight
9171,US Airways,@USAirways   No one picks up the phone all day/  no opportunity to leave a voicemail
9172,US Airways,"@USAirways  Instead, the miles are credited to an account that i did not open
-- My request to merge the accounts is denied"
9173,US Airways,@USAirways No I was there 12 hrs early! Send me an email to share my experience You don't want this blasting here.
9174,US Airways,"@USAirways  I open the credit card and earn 44,000+ miles, and you wont' credit the miles to my account to restore the forfeited miles"
9175,US Airways,@USAirways  you took the miles out of my account and told me that I could restore by paying $150 or opening a credit card
9176,US Airways,"@USAirways  - I had 20,748 miles in  my account and was informed I'd forfeit them bc of 33 months of inactivity - I"
9177,US Airways,@usairways - It's all automated and no one cares to understand the problem I'm having
9178,US Airways,@USAirways screwed me up big. 1st flight 1hr Late Flight. Made it to 2nd flight. CSM daryl wouldn't let me on the plane because we were (1/4)
9179,US Airways,"@USAirways Houston hub Aa T. Employee the bag is not here, It made it to Pa before me! Oops not your problem http://t.co/Uld0hWFkfo"
9180,US Airways,"@USAirways charged my card 11 times for one airline ticket, now card is on security hold"
9181,US Airways,@USAirways not yet. But we will see shortly.
9182,US Airways,@USAirways I've flown US Airways at least five times. Every single time has been like this. Actions speak louder than words.
9183,US Airways,@USAirways flight from Bhm delayed 5hrs! Connect flgt left us in clt at a motel
9184,US Airways,"@USAirways membership has no privileges anymore - my son is in the army, short window to see him - NO help."
9185,US Airways,@USAirways honestly - how is it quickly as possible I've been on hold sine 9:50pm? Everyone that answers has to send me to someone else.
9186,US Airways,@USAirways done it! Process initiated Saturday morning.  Can't get info with website issues &amp; inadequate phone coverage.  How 2 get update??
9187,US Airways,@USAirways yay for glitchy tracking system!  My bags made it to my destination and not Laguardia like the app said!
9188,US Airways,@USAirways really???  NOT ONE OF THEM CAN BOOK DIVIDEND MILES TRAVEL - Literally on hold now since 9:50pm - it's 11:30pm #NoExcuses
9189,US Airways,"@USAirways yeah I know that but that doesn't get me my money back does it, everytime I fly with you something bad happens."
9190,US Airways,"BY THE GRACE OF GOD, I MADE IT! ‚Äú@USAirways: @__RWG__ We don't have those powers in here. We hope you can make that flight.‚Äù"
9191,US Airways,@USAirways Everyone is sorry.  Don't have what I need for meeting tomorrow.  140 charac. isn't nearly enough to highlight your shortcomings
9192,US Airways,@USAirways is the worst. I have to pay $200 just to NOT take my first flight in a round trip! Otherwise they'll Cancelled Flight my whole flight.
9193,US Airways,"@USAirways if it was so important, why did I wait on hold and then get hung up on by your computer?  #disappointed"
9194,US Airways,@USAirways thank u i wiil write after call  travel agency
9195,US Airways,@USAirways terrible service
9196,US Airways,"@USAirways Disgusted with your poor customer service. U wrongfully remove &gt; 65,000 miles from my Dividend Miles and no live person,"
9197,US Airways,@USAirways Please hold flight US 639 in Phoenix! I'm a weary traveler stuck on another flight because the tarmac is having issues!
9198,US Airways,"@USAirways - No live person to speak with all day at Dividend Miles, after they wrongfully took over 65,000 miles out of my account."
9199,US Airways,@USAirways my frustrations are the result of multiple experiences Late Flightly. Currently lost luggage. I want to talk to a real person.
9200,US Airways,"@USAirways cust svc means nothing! So disappointed. Trying since 730a to speak to a human I get bad weather not bad service.
#socialtantrum"
9201,US Airways,"@USAirways yes, but I had to pay more for another flight to get me out tomorrow since there weren't anymore for tonight...not fun :-/"
9202,US Airways,"@USAirways Well, that's a problem considering I need to book a flight tonight for this weekend... is there anything you can do?"

9207,US Airways,"@USAirways was transf, held 15-18 min more b4 agent answered and helped. By time I got to person fare I'd seen was gone.  Had to get supv."
9208,US Airways,@USAirways you are the actual worst.  You have zero respect for your passengers. I'm officially done flying with you.
9209,US Airways,@USAirways has the worst customer service line.  I've called them 8 times today and not once was I able to talk to a real human being.
9210,US Airways,@usairways that wasn't the issue. Someone finally helped on the phone. Now theres a website error that won't let me process my request. SMH
9211,US Airways,@USAirways you say to call travel agency and they say we cant refund because usairways didnt accept this.
9212,US Airways,@USAirways ... I f@$%ing hate you.
9213,US Airways,@USAirways travel agency said that if usairways accept we will refund money i dont understand why dont u refund
9214,US Airways,"@USAirways Yes &amp; have already spent 1K+ on the card &amp; paid the $89 annual fee, but the 50K miles have not shown up. Want to fly AUS --&gt; ATL"
9215,US Airways,@USAirways no i use to skyscanner and travel agency and i called u . You said you should call travel agency but
9216,US Airways,"@USAirways finally spoke with someone. I have to email the refund dept. I love you guys, but 6 hours in line to be told no dice sucks."
9217,US Airways,"@USAirways yes, with Delta!"
9218,US Airways,@USAirways well I thought they had hours ago but just found out that no I do not have a seat
9219,US Airways,"@USAirways : Was on flight 2046 BOS-CLT on 2/22, awful experience, exit row seat was so narrow that I could not move my legs! Unacceptable."
9220,US Airways,"@USAirways yes, but we were answered and put back on hold while they were to check on our request..  50 mins Late Flightr nothing!"
9221,US Airways,@USAirways   Not good. On hold for over an hour. http://t.co/wSgYckCIIO
9222,US Airways,@USAirways Expedia reserved a ticket for me and 2 more for a USAW flight but only issued 1. They are not responsive.Thoughts?
9223,US Airways,"@USAirways no worries, your flight attendant took care of it."
9224,US Airways,@USAirways Thanks for getting back to me. I called that number earlier but no option to leave vm and just rings with busy tone
9225,US Airways,@USAirways I've been on hold for over an hour.  Not doing so well in the customer service department.  #weak
9226,US Airways,@USAirways - 53 minutes on hold for a reservation?
9227,US Airways,@USAirways @joyadventuremom there are breastfeeding momma's watching this story all over the country! Better work on a faster response :)
9228,US Airways,@USAirways #DividendRewards Urgently need to speak with a CS rep. My 50K miles havent shown &amp; I've fulfilled all reqs. Flight Booking Problems flights today
9229,US Airways,@usairways I've been on hold for over an hour only b/c my CC miles aren't showing up. What a mediocre combo of cc &amp; airline #SwitchingBoth
9230,US Airways,@USAirways I am a premium #DividendMiles #cardholder. Unacceptable 4 you to #hangup my #customerservice call twice after putting me on hold.
9231,US Airways,@USAirways I bougth ticket same fligths twice and you dont refund money it is big problem other company refund money why dont u pay back
9232,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir now this is beyond ridiculous. Some steering problem delays us again. #neveragain  it's no wonder you had to sell
9233,US Airways,"@USAirways hi, Im trying to speak with someone to book travel for a minor. The phone keeps disconnecting. Please advise. Website wont allow."
9234,US Airways,@USAirways did a pre schooler develop your app? The thing crashes every single time.
9235,US Airways,@USAirways and @FlyKnoxville - bad weather should not be an excuse for not following established luggage procedures. #NoClothesNoInfo
9236,US Airways,@USAirways On hold for going on 40 minutes after spending 10 hours delayed in Denver cause of a broken plane. Thanks guys.
9237,US Airways,@USAirways #FAILINGYOURCUSTOMER ONE BY ONE
9238,US Airways,@USAirways @PhilaCarService looks like a long trip from cancun to philly? 9 hours Late Flight? Seriously?
9239,US Airways,@USAirways. Yet another delay/missed connection....and your customer service has an attitude with me? Wow.
9240,US Airways,"@USAirways 1,223.22 of unusable funds. Will not book with you again. #usairwaysfailscustomers"
9241,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir Can you bring guinea pigs in small pet carrier onboard your flights?
9242,US Airways,@USAirways #NoService good luck trying to reach a human!  Twice sat on hold for over 50 mins...  #neveragain
9243,US Airways,@USAirways every single time i fly you guys i am delayed at least 30 minutes. Every time. On flight 5612 out of #CLT to nola.
9244,US Airways,@USAirways is it ok for a flight attendant to talk nasty about passengers while they go get drinks by the restroom? I was shocked listening
9245,US Airways,@USAirways good work by flight 1798 crew.  #Chairman's recognition even in coach.  Too many #missedupgrades Late Flightly.  What's up with this?
9246,US Airways,@USAirways changed our flight 6 times in 1 trip. Bumped to @Delta now &amp; having great experience. Never. Flying. US Air again. Never.
9247,US Airways,@USAirways I can't wait to never fly with you again. Always delayed. Always lose my bag. Rudest people on the planet. Southwest is the best
9248,US Airways,@USAirways I sent email to customer.relations@aa.com. Will this work?
9249,US Airways,@USAirways sat on the ramp for 45 min and missed my connection. No one seems to concerned at usairways.
9250,US Airways,@USAirways It's very difficult to work with Baggage claims when they don't answer the phone
9251,US Airways,@USAirways I lost an ID on your plane and having trouble finding a contact for your lost and found in Cleveland Hopkins Airport. Please Help
9252,US Airways,@USAirways I have better Intel than she does!  She said plane is due in at 630.  Flightaware and your own app say 645
9253,US Airways,"@USAirways not likely, flightaware says plane is still in Durango and hasn't departed."
9254,US Airways,"Too little, too Late Flight. You suck RT @USAirways: @mitchsunderland Oh no, Mitchell. Our agents are happy to offer you available options."
9255,US Airways,@USAirways Hi-i have a travel question. Could you please follow me so i can dm you?
9256,US Airways,"@USAirways should, but didn‚Äôt."
9257,US Airways,@USAirways just now but no general announcement
9258,US Airways,@USAirways what's going on with US Airways flight 805?   Why diverted to Charlotte?
9259,US Airways,@USAirways I‚Äôd suggest proper information dissemination to all staff on a more timely &amp; relevant schedule to prevent this in the future.
9260,US Airways,@USAirways i have been patient.. especially the first time. i will never fly with you again
9261,US Airways,@USAirways seriously? Every flight I have had the past 2 days has been delayed. Every single one. Terrible
9262,US Airways,@USAirways I just want to be heard and to discuss the many issues on my trip
9263,US Airways,@USAirways what's up with flight 5545 no gate agent or plane at PHX B18?  Nice customer service.
9264,US Airways,@USAirways very embarrassing.
9265,US Airways,@USAirways I‚Äôm still disappointed that it is apparently ok for a Flight Attendant who isn‚Äôt up on current policy to argue with a traveler.
9266,US Airways,@USAirways yes I know the industry procedure on baggage. Thanks for helping..... üòâ what about the impossible connection that started this?
9267,US Airways,@USAirways I agree but per the captain this issue happened before boarding &amp; we all sat in the plane for almost 2 hrs
9268,US Airways,@USAirways and despite tailwind‚Ä¶ Will still be Late Flight.
9269,US Airways,@USAirways 1500 characters are not enough to convey the issue. Was directed to emailmailto:customer.relations@usairways.com unmonitored. BAD
9270,US Airways,@USAirways Thanks! Sent you DM re: baggage issues.
9271,US Airways,"@USAirways i have and you have not been able to locate them, its insane. i trust you and PAY you to look after my things and you lost them."
9272,US Airways,@USAirways and yet the Flight Attendant argued with me over Exec Plat benefits...
9273,US Airways,@USAirways please stop asking me each week to place my bag in the size check #ITFITS http://t.co/AUrn07pWD4
9274,US Airways,@USAirways  has me on my toes whether I'm going to make my flight back to Boston tonight
9275,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir need to check candy w working flight 449 iah to phx on usairways she is the reason I always choose @Delta #rude
9276,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir explain how come I can get a free upgrade on US as an exe plat but not exit row seating w/out paying. confused
9277,US Airways,"@USAirways Yes, ground crew finally showed up so plane could depart very Late Flight."
9278,US Airways,"@USAirways #686 is delayed due to tail winds and need to jump on #521 to SEA, leaving the same time this arrives. Is there a chance to hold?"
9279,US Airways,@USAirways I have submitted my request. I would appreciate a call by 9am eastern. Thank you.
9280,US Airways,"@USAirways  I need to email customer service for help and a question, can you please provide the email address?"
9281,US Airways,@USAirways @VincesViews  there are significant number of folks on 686 connecting to 599 a few minutes hold would make many happy
9282,US Airways,@USAirways  can you help me out?
9283,US Airways,@USAirways is anything being done to make Flight Attendants aware of AA member benefits? Embarrassing being argued with. Just happened.
9284,US Airways,@USAirways i have a question. i need to talk to someone by email. Can you give me your email address? Thanks.
9285,US Airways,"@USAirways @Gregm528 well there is certainly nothing happening ""in front"" of the scenes. #Noaccountability  #disappointing"
9286,US Airways,@USAirways 4 hours on tarmac in Charleston and still can't get a response after a week. Unacceptable
9287,US Airways,@USAirways customer service at its best! Rachel S.  took great care of us at the PHX airport. http://t.co/HG7vEqhGHy
9288,US Airways,@usairways &amp; @AmericanAir planes in #grandcayman http://t.co/GX7QbtckBr
9289,US Airways,@USAirways  I will never fly us airways again.
9290,US Airways,@USAirways strikes again--Late Flight crew #3/4 for the trip and maintenance #2/4.  Worth the extra $200/trip for less hassle and fewer delays
9291,US Airways,"@USAirways Can you follow, so I can DM you?"
9292,US Airways,@USAirways so I get bumped to the 6pm to Birmingham which is now delayed because the pilots scheduled don't have enough hours together. Fail
9293,US Airways,"@USAirways yes, thanks but took forever"
9294,US Airways,@USAirways as far as being delayed goes‚Ä¶ Looks like tailwinds are going to make up for it. Good news!
9295,US Airways,@USAirways horrible travel day w/ your airlines. My 2:20 flight to Birmingham was Cancelled Flightled w/ no notification so I couldn't get on the 4:05
9296,US Airways,"@USAirways I asked if that was SOP, and they said ‚ÄúIt is now.‚Äù But yet the other 11 flights, nothing. Is this a policy or not?"
9297,US Airways,"@USAirways while I‚Äôm asking‚Ä¶ 2 of my 11 non upgraded flights, Attendants came &amp; greeted me &amp; thanked me for my business b/c I was Exec Plat."
9298,US Airways,@USAirways 24 hrs of traveling and this just welcomes u back home to the US. 4 hr layover and I get to watch it going to wrong destination.
9299,US Airways,@USAirways it is really embarrassing when asking for complimentary drink/snack detailed here: https://t.co/9zA6xb1h89 &amp; being argued with.
9300,US Airways,@USAirways I am so disappointed with the service I received with you on my travels to NC these past few days .. you lost my baggage twice.
9301,US Airways,@USAirways but question :  if the downgrade include losing first class do you get money back ? http://t.co/LfT7QD23Sy
9302,US Airways,.@USAirways Have you just given up?
9303,US Airways,.@USAirways and then you said I could move my Thursday flight for free if I CALL A NUMBER. And then you HANG UP ON ME.
9304,US Airways,@USAirways Are you not even going to acknowledge that you bumped me from a flight (NOT BECAUSE OF WEATHER I AM IN ARIZONA)
9305,US Airways,"@USAirways Your ""moveup"" policy really sucks. United has a 24 hour policy for this with status. I was wanting to move up from 5am to 7am..."
9306,US Airways,Great management of @USAirways twitter account. Thank you.
9307,US Airways,@USAirways why is it impossible to change / buy preferred seats via your app?
9308,US Airways,@USAirways I am good. I just did not understand the terminology.  but the merger brings new verbiage
9309,US Airways,@USAirways can you priv chat to help chairman reroute
9310,US Airways,@USAirways New marketing song? https://t.co/F2LFULCbQ7 let us know what you think? http://t.co/WbhbljJkS7

9318,US Airways,@USAirways your customer service # has a recording that says we are to busy to assist and hangs up. Great touch. #poorservice @GMA @CBSNews
9319,US Airways,@USAirways your lack of customer service has shined. I need you to step up and get my lost baggage to delta. So they can return it to me.
9320,US Airways,"@USAirways do you operate ANY flights without maintenance issues? Flights in/out of DCA Cancelled Flighted, this is getting old. Update fleet pls!"
9321,US Airways,@USAirways And you took away my 1st class seat.  Love being a Chairman Preferred and assigned row 24 seat B middle seat
9322,US Airways,@USAirways patience is what my connecting flight will need. Why do you guys do this to me every time I travel? Every. Single. Time.
9323,US Airways,@USAirways PLANS CHANGED! IS THAT WHAT U CALL NOT BEIN ABLE 2 PARK ON TIME PLANES W A 2 HR LAYOVER N B ABLE 2 MAKE UR CONNECTION! #seriously
9324,US Airways,@USAirways I have a receipt but no conf # for a Thur flight. When I call for help I was literally hung up on b/c of wait times. Help!
9325,US Airways,@USAirways is it your practice to give 1st class seats to us air employees before giving them to chairmans customers sitting in coach?
9326,US Airways,@USAirways THANK YOU for resolving the issue. On direct flight to sfo from @united
9327,US Airways,@USAirways would help if you flew bigger planes into TLH. All my team mates made it to the training but me.
9328,US Airways,@USAirways ok thanks
9329,US Airways,@USAirways no I am trying to get on a plane from Phx to RNO and the gate is saying the flight was downgraded.
9330,US Airways,@USAirways She was put on hold on that number for a loooooong time too.  No help. #lostandforgotten
9331,US Airways,@USAirways I have never had a more unpleasant travel experience in my life. Now I might not get on my flight till tomorrow? This is insane
9332,US Airways,@USAirways direct flights to SFO leaving from same airport with @VirginAmerica and @united - can you please put me on one of those?
9333,US Airways,"@USAirways awesome... Doors close in 2 minutes, flight leaves in 17 minutes... And the plane just got here. WTH?"
9334,US Airways,@USAirways I'll check it out when I get to the airport. Thanks.
9335,US Airways,@USAirways ticket counter people here are not helping and just want to charge more money even after this horrible day.
9336,US Airways,@USAirways - HA! flight to CTL delayed! Going to miss connection. Can you please transfer me to another airline asap? http://t.co/1XdLbiBClP
9337,US Airways,"@USAirways thanks for the reply. On a good note, the pilot nailed the landing. Seriously. Kudos."
9338,US Airways,@USAirways on 5:55 flight to CTL to catch 8pm flight to sfo. But empty seats on 4:15 flight which wasn't offered.  Awful service continues.
9339,US Airways,@USAirways I have to fly back to Charlotte out of a different airport. You guys are not very flexible like other airlines.
9340,US Airways,"@USAirways I checked in ""Standby for 1st Class"" only to find I am ""not on the list"". This merger is a pain."
9341,US Airways,@USAirways 4 great flights with no delays! Thank you!
9342,US Airways,@USAirways been on hold for 45 minutes. Is there a better time to call? This is getting ridiculous
9343,US Airways,@USAirways Your exchange/credit policies are worthless and shadier than the White House. Dissatisfied to the nines right now.
9344,US Airways,@USAirways honest question - how is a 1-way ticket from Charlotte (your hub) to LAX (2nd biggest city in USA) almost $600?????
9345,US Airways,@USAirways  how does one downgrade a flight?
9346,US Airways,@USAirways I'm shutting my data off for the flight. I want some response by the time I land.  You have 2 hours.
9347,US Airways,@USAirways only happened because u couldn't get us home the next day. #flydelta #flysouthwest #flyjetblue #theyareallbetter #stillnobags

9354,US Airways,@USAirways look out for flying rocks this time! It's a bird it's a plane! Nah never mind it's just a rock...
9355,US Airways,@USAirways doesn't take into account the $450 it cost 2 rent a car 2 drive home
9356,US Airways,"@USAirways even if I was the single most unreasonable human being on planet earth, there is no excuse for his treatment of me."
9357,US Airways,@USAirways you are supposed to be in the business of belong customers; not humiliating them
9358,US Airways,@USAirways this is no way to treat women.  I want someone to contact me and explain how they will make this acceptable.
9359,US Airways,@USAirways citizen. I fly your airline constantly and am so offended.  Derrick Bussey. Now Im crying on this airplane because I'm so upset
9360,US Airways,@USAirways @united really know how to leave someone stranded after a funeral. Props to you guys. Really making this the perfect Monday.

9365,US Airways,@USAirways with such disrespect I cannot even begin to explain. He has an issue with women and he literally yelled at me and pulled me off
9366,US Airways,@USAirways what happens if it isn't located
9367,US Airways,@USAirways I want to speak with someone immediately. I am shaking with rage. I offered to hate check my bag and Derrick bussey treated me
9368,US Airways,@USAirways so it's a $25.00 bag fee for a golf bag on a domestic flight?
9369,US Airways,@USAirways is okay for u 2 Cancelled Flight change a flight when good 4 u but you cant logistically figure out what 2 do when a plane comes in on time
9370,US Airways,@USAirways Thanks but when I asked for a change with no cost for you the only desition was nade by computer. Now is Late Flight
9371,US Airways,"@USAirways hi guys, do you have a general enquires email address please? Thanks David."
9372,US Airways,@USAirways if you actually cared about what you did it would be one thing. Sounds like you don't like being told how lousy your service is.
9373,US Airways,@USAirways you idiots kept an on time plane on the Tarmac for over an hour forcing us to not be there 10 minutes before.
9374,US Airways,@USAirways cust svc just let it slip that previous cust svc lied to me about supervisors &amp; corporate ph#. $200 to change a $130 tix? No thx.

9385,US Airways,"@USAirways if I apply for ur credit card, do you automatically get the companion certificate or do I have to wait for it?"
9386,US Airways,"@USAirways customer service failure aside, one would think you guys would care about inaccurate manifests. I'm sure TSA would."
9387,US Airways,@USAirways I find it funny that @PHLAirport responds but you don't. Your customer service is the worst. #wedontcarebecauseyoupaidalready
9388,US Airways,@USAirways I get some bs from a guy at the door says door closes 10 minutes before it backs out. Yet I know for a fact it was 5 people short
9389,US Airways,@USAirways our flight was rebooked with you and we want to change our seats or upgrade to 1st class. Can you help? Phones are down.
9390,US Airways,@USAirways I need to speak with a customer service agent today between 5-8pm  I had an unfortunate incident of discrimination today.
9391,US Airways,@USAirways @CLTDouglas slowest baggage claim ever
9392,US Airways,@USAirways Don't blame it on weather. Rep at counter cost me entire day - not weather.  Printed Boarding Pass too Late Flight. #TakeResponsibility
9393,US Airways,@USAirways too Late Flight.
9394,US Airways,@USAirways delays due to refueling are out of your control? If that's true I never want to fly US Airways again
9395,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir shout out to Diane at EYW for helping get us home today instead of tomorrow (even if a little Late Flight!)
9396,US Airways,@USAirways made it! Just! Huge relief - thanks for your help!
9397,US Airways,@USAirways how about now getting us the rest of our bags please? We only received 2 of 5. Can you help with that?
9398,US Airways,@usairways im trying to get my dads wheelchair and no one is answering at Dulles.we have tried to call back on.multiple times
9399,US Airways,"@USAirways It's 838. We boarded and we are waiting now to take off, hopefully."
9400,US Airways,"@USAirways - thanks, I hope so. Maybe you can put in a good word for me? ;-)"
9401,US Airways,@USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Arrive 7 hrs Late Flight; checked car seat missing. No replacement available. Has yet to arrive more than 24 hours Late Flightr.
9402,US Airways,@USAirways you guys lost my luggage
9403,US Airways,@USAirways US 728/Feb 21 Kim Y says: leaving on 15 minutes once paperwork is done. Wheels up ~ 1.5 hours Late Flightr.
9404,US Airways,@USAirways US 728/Feb 21 Hour 6 on plane when US Airways representative Kim Y enters deteriorating picture. Unhelpful with no assurances.
9405,US Airways,"@USAirways @marvinatorsb thnk you for response,all flights were full, couldn't get out until tmrw, had to Cancelled Flight and go w/other airline"
9406,US Airways,@USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Ground power shorts again for the third time. Weary German passenger deplanes. Makes me jealous. Auf wiedersehen!
9407,US Airways,"@USAirways US 728. Refuel; we've sat for so long. Pilot announces where the truck is. ""Look, over there to the left!"" Actual announcement."
9408,US Airways,@USAirways thanks but the bags are only 10% of what went wrong. 22 hours from DCA to SAN when there were no weather issues is not acceptable
9409,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir trying to chg ticket for staff member leaving org before she can fly.We're a nonprofit-can't you make an exception?
9410,US Airways,@USAirways How can I speak to a human? Need 2 find bag delayed 2/21. Website and 800 # are telling me 2 different things! Got hung up on 2x
9411,US Airways,@USAirways US 728. One water run of the planet's smallest water bottles. Applaud you looking out for the environment.
9412,US Airways,"@USAirways US 728. Nope, not getting off. 3 hours in the plane. 4 pilot announcements. One water run of the planet's smallest water bottles."
9413,US Airways,"@USAirways US 728 Wait, now a gate opened. Back we go. (Good, maybe we can get off.)"
9414,US Airways,"@USAirways US 728 Uh oh, no gate. Now truck will come to us."
9415,US Airways,"@USAirways US 728 returned to gate to get ""MEL"" sticker. Oh, look. We heard from pilot! No clue what an MEL sticker is. Anyone?"
9416,US Airways,@USAirways I spent an hour on the phone with them and got no where at all
9417,US Airways,"@USAirways US 728 then lost ground power three different times. Not only grounded endlessly; now without air, lights, entertainment."
9418,US Airways,"@USAirways US 728 pilot started the flight by announcing arrival into Gatwick, not Heathrow. Moments of concern for all aboard."
9419,US Airways,@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: no one around to close said door. More strange. Now we're not hearing from pilot for long periods.
9420,US Airways,@USAirways Seat 8D on Flight 545 last night is the worst seat I've ever been in.  No leg room! #dividendsmember http://t.co/NUhpLNXRIq
9421,US Airways,@USAirways One of your workers was very rude with us. We can tell you in DM cuz it won't be any good publicity...
9422,US Airways,"@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: plane not moving as cargo door open on plane. Umm, ok. A little strange."
9423,US Airways,@USAirways my flight is delayed so I missed my connecting flight. Stuck in Philadelphia over night and no hotel voucher? Thanks for nothing
9424,US Airways,@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: kept plane on ground to allow connecting passengers from other flight to board. Fine. Understand.
9425,US Airways,"@USAirways can I speak to a human with some compassion? I wrote an email to discuss my experience and received a generic ""sorry"" email back"
9426,US Airways,"@USAirways take a look at 1715. All F seats filled, so someone upgraded their friend instead of following rules."
9427,US Airways,@USAirways back in line at terminal because phone guy couldn't help.  One person in front of me 20 min wait again? http://t.co/HQHdAD7fvK
9428,US Airways,@USAirways So you understand why I'm resorting to Twitter: No help available at  gate while this occurred or by phone afterward.
9429,US Airways,@USAirways going to miss my connection due to another tarmac delay - on US5268 then 4050 - need a flight home today please!
9430,US Airways,"@USAirways, I'm expecting 400% reimbursement for the unprofessional decisions with US728 on 21 Feb. Check your very full complaint box."
9431,US Airways,"@USAirways what's the deal with flight 5268 from DCA to PHL? We boarded on time, left the gate a few mins Late Flight and are now sat on Tarmac?"
9432,US Airways,@USAirways stranding a student trying to get to Birmingham in CLT overnight w/o any help.  You can do better than that.  @av_duffy
9433,US Airways,"@usairways really need help asap, so please make it quick. Thx."
9434,US Airways,@USAirways well that is not going to help. I'vebeen on hold over 3 hrs &amp; my client wants his ff nbr in the record he's elite wAA
9435,US Airways,@usairways hi. You lost my father's wheelchair. Every time we call we just get voicemail. My dad needs it to go home. Please DM me.
9436,US Airways,"@USAirways 4 segments, 4/4 delayed. Gnv &gt; CTL . CTL &gt; JAN . JAN &gt; CTL . CTL &gt; GNV. My year off from flying with you guys was the way to go."
9437,US Airways,@USAirways is charging me $200 to NOT take my flight. Lol. That is the last time I fly with them.
9438,US Airways,@USAirways yes. It says bag is being delivered. The local number says Not Open. Asked main # for cust service got hung up on.
9439,US Airways,"@usairways Row 16, flight 634 today if you're looking for specifics! I can run to Home Depot for the WD40 you if you need."
9440,US Airways,@USAirways seriously buy some WD40 for A319 operating flight 634 from GEG to Phoenix. Every seat squeaks w every shift. Still on ground!
9441,US Airways,"@USAirways I would happily wait in the terminal near food, restrooms and non irritated passengers."
9442,US Airways,@USAirways why let passengers on board when there was an issue? Over an hour &amp; the pilot doesn't know when we'll leave.
9443,US Airways,@USAirways anyone there to help? Still on hold...
9444,US Airways,@USAirways oh yay! Now gate agents decide not to deal with upgrade list and just bump up whoever is closest.
9445,US Airways,@USAirways site shows on-time but FlightAware site shows delayed. Trying to decide if I get out in this ice to catch FLT 456 to PHX.
9446,US Airways,@USAirways is the absolute worst airline. 13 women were inconvenienced due to maintenance issues. Stuck all over- no care given.
9447,US Airways,"@USAirways flights &amp; ""customer relations"" are extremely disappointing. Faced too many problems to type. apology=$25 towards a flight. A JOKE"
9448,US Airways,@USAirways sitting here in PHL with all of your rude Customer Service Agents!
9449,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir - Can flight #415 get the paperwork inputted?? We should have taken off an hour .. #sittingontheplane #hungry
9450,US Airways,@USAirways now on hold with customer care.  Wonder if someone will pick up the phone before 5pm.
9451,US Airways,@USAirways when will FLT 445 get a gate at DEN? Over 20 minutes waiting with no information.
9452,US Airways,@USAirways lots of fun to be removed from top of a list and manually readded to the bottom thanks to club agents. Thanks a lot Asha at DCA.
9453,US Airways,@USAirways your delayed flight out of Wilmington made me miss my flight out of Charlotte. Figure out how to take off and arrive on time.
9454,US Airways,@USAirways Wow unbelievable how you treat your customers at Puerto Rico airport! üëç
9455,US Airways,"@USAirways usually ""sorry"" doesn't involve moving people to middle seats and removing them from upgrade lists. Guess that's a club perk."
9456,US Airways,@USAirways don't worry. Used own initiative and arriving much earlier than you planned for me
9457,US Airways,@USAirways nice try at the gate making traveler after traveler put bags in the size guide because you oversold.  Sorry #minefits
9458,US Airways,"@USAirways horrible service, wrong plane arrived, many confirmed passengers could not get on flight we paid for due to lack of seats flight"
9459,US Airways,@USAirways trying to book award travel leaving on red-eye Sunday night after midnight. Should I book the date in Sunday or Monday?
9460,US Airways,"@USAirways booked flight 1mnth ago, seat CONFIRMED, small plane arrived and was not allowed to board bcs no seat, horrible service"
9461,US Airways,"@USAirways Very frustrated, checked bag in Logan, was not given a luggage ticket,now luggage is lost &amp; no ownership from @USAirways"
9462,US Airways,@USAirways They were breathing very heavily. but were super helpful. Thank you.
9463,US Airways,"@USAirways Aye, and nothing to do with an automated system which doesn't work properly. Anyway, got through to somebody..."
9464,US Airways,"@USAirways okay, great. Thank you!"
9465,US Airways,@USAirways now my rebooked connection is delayed.
9466,US Airways,@USAirways I am in meetings in California and have no luggage!!
9467,US Airways,@USAirways And the number your agent gave me to call says you are not open? And the main number goes to a computer saying it is delivered?
9468,US Airways,@USAirways any way to get your call center to answer for a OneWorld award? Whenever try system says too busy and disconnect or endless hold
9469,US Airways,@USAirways Why did you put my luggage on the plane after mine? Then not deliver it to me like you said? Now show the claim as closed online?
9470,US Airways,@USAirways takes my money at once but then requires 7 to 10 days to process a refund? Why does your auto attendant hang up? #usairwaysfail
9471,US Airways,@USAirways how long for a reply
9472,US Airways,@USAirways Bag policy says stroller OR car seat.  We need to bring 2 car seats and 1 stroller.  Should I just call for details?
9473,US Airways,@USAirways it was customer service like I have never seen before!  Kudos to your organization.
9474,US Airways,@USAirways Who intentionally buys a flight with a 10 hour layover?  And what kind of airline would charge $200 to fix it? Wow... #usairways
9475,US Airways,@USAirways how do I get a hold of customer service? I've called multiple times &amp; have been on hold for 30+ mins only to have to hang up
9476,US Airways,@USAirways is there a # or a time bracket I can call to fix this problem?I've been attempting to fix this contact information issue for days
9477,US Airways,@USAirways I called the number and they said no one is available to take my call...guys this is insane
9478,US Airways,.@USAirways Can't book a flight online or over the phone. Your customer service is usually great -- anything you can do to help?
9479,US Airways,"@USAirways / @AmericanAir was the worst experience I've ever had flying. Rude, delays, Cancelled Flightlations, lack of updates, and wasting our time"
9480,US Airways,"@USAirways contact via FB messages, Twitter DM or text?"
9481,US Airways,@USAirways called 3x &amp; it says high call volumes call back. At $1 a minute for international calls is there any way someone can contact me?
9482,US Airways,@USAirways @jhughes1025 grrrrrrrr. Couldn't book a flight via calling either :(
9483,US Airways,"@USAirways delayed, connection missed, now extended layover how about a lounge pass for PHL. #5077"

9555,US Airways,"@USAirways @AmericanAir ""ma'am the doors close 10 mins prior to departure"" ""but I was here 20 mins before?!?"" laughter from the 2 agents"
9556,US Airways,"@USAirways @AmericanAir at 9:05am after the plane left: ""why were there no agents and why were the doors closed so early?"""
9557,US Airways,@USAirways I called more than 25 times to redeem mile points and can't get through.  You advertise the miles but make them very hard to use!

9566,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir can someone help me with some travel issues today?
9567,US Airways,"@USAirways First the pilot was Late Flight, now it's maintenance. This is EXACTLY what happened two weeks ago. Unacceptable."
9568,US Airways,"@USAirways There is nothing on my USAir CC at this point, but the email stated I would be charged.  Thanks for the reply."
9569,US Airways,@USAirways I will NEVER fly us airways or american again and I will share this nightmare of a story to all the many others we know who fly
9570,US Airways,"@USAirways i have never been treated so poorly by an airline in my life, as a military family we do alot of flying.."
9571,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir - Burned a lot of time and cell minutes working through this flight issue - hopefully we fly home in the morning.

9593,US Airways,"@USAirways. On hold 2hrs after my flight was Cancelled Flightled &amp; ""Anthony"" was beyond rude and not helpful! @AmericanAir they're weighing you down."
9594,US Airways,"@USAirways Will the nightmare ever end? Just found out our flight today is delayed due to ""ground handling delays affecting a prior flight."""
9595,US Airways,@USAirways is alright with me. Please give Scott F at BDL a bonus for excellent customer service
9596,US Airways,"@USAirways : When You've Got to Get There, We've Got Excuses! #usairwaysfail"

9604,US Airways,@USAirways thank you for the apology

9607,US Airways,‚Äú@USAirways: @hegshmeg O‚Äù thank you for that elaborate response
9608,US Airways,@USAirways You guys are screwing up my trip. Thanks for nothing. #lazy
9609,US Airways,@USAirways Is your refund system down?
9610,US Airways,@usairways Seriously. This is ridiculous. I shouldn't have to wait a hour for my luggage after I land. #wtf
9611,US Airways,"That's not the case.. They sent me a email with a link, I'll show you.. @USAirways http://t.co/hb799CCo0t"
9612,US Airways,@usairways Why are we waiting 40 min so far for our luggage??? #wannagohome
9613,US Airways,@USAirways the only time I tweet is to tell you how horrible you're attendants are. Flight 3841 to LGA. I feel in jail
9614,US Airways,@USAirways hello??? Anyone there?
9615,US Airways,@USAirways forced sections 4 and 5 to check their carry on. would have packed differently to check my bag. Why even allow it? #pissed
9616,US Airways,"@USAirways Raleigh to Chicago and no #firstclass upgrade. Must be flying AA 'the screw USAir Elite, after we bailed them out' Airline"
9617,US Airways,"@USAirways flt 419. 2+ hrs Late Flight, baggage + 1 more hr. Now I see they delivered my suitcase wet inside &amp; out. #NotHappy"
9618,US Airways,@USAirways then she had to get her own hotel so ur agents did nothing to help and to top it off you sent her luggage on the wrong flight!!!
9619,US Airways,"@USAirways so she has to take a Late Flightr flight booked by her corporate (Disney) travel dept, as your agent offered little help"
9620,US Airways,@USAirways your computer system went down ok that is understandable but the agents make it worse by not helping her or anyone else
9621,US Airways,"@USAirways as the employee responsible for social media content, yes u probably do care however the actions from last night say otherwise"
9622,US Airways,@USAirways Flight gets in 30 minutes early and all goodwill gone when bags aren't here 45 minutes Late Flightr
9623,US Airways,"@USAirways. wow, awful customer service."
9624,US Airways,@USAirways merging with American will negatively affect your quality and integrity. I will no longer fly with you because of it.
9625,US Airways,@USAirways How many agents do you have working to handle the thousands of calls?
9626,US Airways,@USAirways YOU ARE THE BEST!!! YOU ARE AMAZING!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE;)üôèüôèüôè
9627,US Airways,@USAirways flight 435 is delayed so will miss connecting flight 457 can you please help with alternate? Thank you.
9628,US Airways,"@USAirways 4469, thank you for asking."
9629,US Airways,@USAirways three hour wait and counting waiting for reservations on the phone. Are you serious!?
9630,US Airways,@USAirways on a happy note our 719 crew is wonderful. Can't say enough great things about our pilot. He's doing all he can for us.
9631,US Airways,@USAirways What a mess caused by the computer systems. Flight 719 in 3 hours Late Flight and now no gate for us. Est 26 min wait.
9632,US Airways,"@USAirways Storm or no storm, your customer service is a joke. 6 hour wait time to speak to someone? I will never fly your airline again."
9633,US Airways,@USAirways you guys have my luggage in San Jose and were supposed to deliver it to my hotel hours ago!! Please contact me.
9634,US Airways,@USAirways I've flown 6 figured worth of miles in my lifetime.  This was my first and last ever flight on US Airways
9635,US Airways,@USAirways pls get me back to Tallahassee:( no one should ever have to be stranded in Gainesville for this longüòí
9636,US Airways,@USAirways your a miserable airline and your loss of revenue is a reflection of that.  Go extinct.  A merger only delays the inevitable
9637,US Airways,@USAirways What was the point of the merger?  Why not just go out of business if your not turning a profit anymore?
9638,US Airways,@USAirways I love how just to give feedback to this link I have to fill out all my personal info on a form.  You guys are the best :)
9639,US Airways,@USAirways Finally got ahold of an Agent after another hour. Thanks for the follow up.  Recommend a call back feature.
9640,US Airways,@USAirways IS THIS RINGLING BROTHERS BARNUM AND BAILEY???  SHOULD I KEEP MY EYES PEELED FOR THE CLOWN CAR???
9641,US Airways,@USAirways not to mention the fact that my flight was delayed BECAUSE YOUR COMPUTERS WERE DOWN
9642,US Airways,@USAirways cannot add my frequent flyer number on your website.  Can you help?
9643,US Airways,@USAirways how do I get off my plane and wait over an hour and a half to speak to someone about reFlight Booking Problems?
9644,US Airways,"@USAirways Please don't trivialize me.  This is a joke, not a slow day or slow experience"
9645,US Airways,@USAirways And how do you only have 1 agent at PHX customer service desk when an hour ago the line was over 100 people long?
9646,US Airways,@USAirways sorry doesn't help.  It's midnight PST.  How in the hell am I still on hold after 90 minutes on customer service line?
9647,US Airways,@USAirways Like I thought this was America.  When did US Airways start operating under the rules of communist Russia?
9648,US Airways,@USAirways you guys should be nice and just give your routes to jet blue and southwest.  At least they treat their customers properly.
9649,US Airways,@USAirways But nope!  Apparently this is the way you guys do business!  I guess I'm flying southwest and her blue from now on.
9650,US Airways,@USAirways I keep thinking this is a massive practical joke and someone is gonna appear out of thin air and take me to Reno tonight.
9651,US Airways,@USAirways there's over 50 people in line and only one agent!
9652,US Airways,"@USAirways And by the way, I'm planning it while I've Ben waiting in the line at customer service in PHX...for over an hour!"
9653,US Airways,"@USAirways Already planning my local boycott for Washington, D.C. Area."
9654,US Airways,@USAirways I can legitimately say that I would have rather driven cross country than flown on US Airways.
9655,US Airways,@USAirways and despite the fact I see you answering all these people on twitter with mundane qs you refuse to answer me!
9656,US Airways,"@USAirways you guys are the worst airline I've ever dealt with.  No notifications, no keeping customers updated.  Terrible service"
9657,US Airways,@USAirways hey guys!  Thanks for answering me and thanks for keeping me on hold for an hour on customer service at 12 pm PST!
9658,US Airways,"@USAirways @PDQuigley any progress? Good luck, Patrick!"
9659,US Airways,"@USAirways @landonschott he's fine, he really likes picking his own seat...."
9660,US Airways,@USAirways is the worst airline to ever travel with.
9661,US Airways,"@USAirways has to be the most lazy, inconsiderate, and unprofessional airline that I have ever traveled."
9662,US Airways,@USAirways Do you have any pride in your service? Any concerns for my wife and everyone else on that flight? Or you just don't care????!!!
9663,US Airways,@USAirways now U horrible people say you have no where for her to sleep?
9664,US Airways,@USAirways who's in charge of your company? My wife missed her connection to CA you sent her luggage on another flight
9665,US Airways,@USAirways the call hung up on me..
9666,US Airways,@USAirways got this message on your site to call about my flight - just gave up after being on hold for 3 HOURS! http://t.co/5cDX2ROAE6
9667,US Airways,@USAirways #usairways lost a passenger today for not upholding their promise of excellent customer service!!!
9668,US Airways,@USAirways yet again your staff in Philadelphia  failed to send my luggage home with me. #alwayshappensthere #angrytraveler
9669,US Airways,@USAirways  ok my 4th try today....giving up at 12.45am after 138 minute hold time. #terrible http://t.co/Ps9Q9RPSiL
9670,US Airways,Number or email? That's the purpose of sending you a tweet? @USAirways
9671,US Airways,@USAirways Thank you. I'll do that next time!
9672,US Airways,@USAirways it still says that I can't check into my flight because the information is incorrect but everything is entered correctly
9673,US Airways,@USAirways this says it was estimated to leave an hour ago (it hasn't left yet) so thanks for this useful information. #TheWorstAirline
9674,US Airways,@USAirways your customer service is horrendous. Between the way employees speak customers and their lack of care for problems with flights.
9675,US Airways,@USAirways had mom sit for 3 hours waiting for a flight they ultimately Cancelled Flighted to give her a Tuesday morning flight...no compensation. Ugh
9676,US Airways,@USAirways does anyone from your airline know how to do their job?
9677,US Airways,@USAirways Has To Be THE WORST Airline Of All Timeüò°üò°üò°
9678,US Airways,@USAirways denied me standby bc of checked bag in cvg 5163 to Phl @ 6..so I had to take delayed 3751 4 hrs Late Flightr...except u lost bag in cvg
9679,US Airways,@USAirways you reminded me today why I fly @SouthwestAir
9680,US Airways,@USAirways looks like our bag has been rescued. Thanks!
9681,US Airways,@USAirways .... I've been trying to get through to book a reservation and the system will not let me through. Day 3 #ridiculous
9682,US Airways,@USAirways you are the worst.
9683,US Airways,@USAirways making folks run from gate C29 to A18 to B11 with NO EXPLANATION and zero carts to transfer elderly and handicap. #PHL
9684,US Airways,@USAirways have been waiting in an airplane for a total of 3 hours to take off between 2 flights today...this usually doesn't happen...
9685,US Airways,@USAirways not given option for new flight! Why can't we get a plane PHL-MIA? 20years as an #eventprof this is worst travel experience ever
9686,US Airways,@USAirways doesn't let u do stand by on flight due to checked bag causing u to get in 5 hours Late Flightr only to get to PHL &amp; bag didn't make it
9687,US Airways,@USAirways and @AmericanAir aren't as merged as the marketing departments would have us believe. Maybe @Delta or @united can get me home?
9688,US Airways,"@USAirways absolutely worst experience of my life at PHL. 6 hrs, 1 failed departure, 3 gates, and ZERO communication or help!!"
9689,US Airways,"@USAirways @AmericanAir as soon as I call customer service to speak to a representative, I am disconnected"
9690,US Airways,"@USAirways @AmericanAir have been trying to call customer service since 9pm. After an hour, was disconnected. Spoke to no one"
9691,US Airways,@USAirways give us no information and an attitude.
9692,US Airways,@USAirways Looking for some help to recover an item I left on an airplane this evening
9693,US Airways,@USAirways attendants at the gate. Enjoyed watching the other flight to our destination take off before having a horrible attendant give us
9694,US Airways,"@USAirways now has stranded is in #Miami without updating any of the departure boards, and once they Cancelled Flightled the flight there was no..."
9695,US Airways,@USAirways you are absolutely terrible at managing these delays... Been delayed and undelayed and delayed 6 times now. 10 AM office hours.
9696,US Airways,"@USAirways @AmericanAir have the most rude, unreliable, horrible company with equally rude, unreliable and horrible employees. Stay tuned."
9697,US Airways,"@USAirways #PHL why does it take an hour to offload bags, especially after taking 30+ min to get a jetway to get off plane after landing?"
9698,US Airways,"@USAirways flight #703 Philly -&gt; Mia? Bwahahaha! Delayed 5+ hrs, were in the air 30 mins then turned back around. #usairwaysfail"
9699,US Airways,@USAirways I'm tired of paying for luggage &amp; less than stellar customer service @AmericanAir. #notafanofyourmerger
9700,US Airways,@USAirways have you heard about the debacle at DCA? What is happening with our New Orleans flight? #wewanttoknow
9701,US Airways,@USAirways I think it's a little weak sauce you have zero inflight entertainment for a 4 hour flight from Salt Lake to Philadelphia
9702,US Airways,"@USAirways we flew out, through and into good weather. when we landed,  another technical issue with gate. improve service or lose customers"
9703,US Airways,"@USAirways - is stranding your customers, not reFlight Booking Problems them, and then not answering the phone the way you treat Platinum members?"
9704,US Airways,@USAirways I made a reservation online but I didn't receive any confirmation email. My bank said the transaction went through. Can u help?
9705,US Airways,@USAirways This is the worst flying experience of my life. Flight scheduled for departure at 5:44pm from Phl. 5+ hrs Late Flightr guess where I am?
9706,US Airways,@USAirways Have you issued a Memphis travel advisory for tomorrow? Winter weather coming through now.
9707,US Airways,@USAirways any update on this flight?It's more than three hours delayed. Thank you.
9708,US Airways,"@USAirways @AmericanAir you should partner w/ a different hotel in PHL, the clarion is proving to be very difficult &amp; not customer friendly"
9709,US Airways,@USAirways truly dissapointed when our flight is delayed and going to miss connection that we are expected to rebook our own flight????????
9710,US Airways,"@USAirways - you kind of screwed my day up, at least it was outbound, but you did save it by stranding me in a @RenHotels @MarriottRewards"
9711,US Airways,@USAirways nightmare trying to get to Costa Rica from PHL today. Stuck in Miami and no one answers at 800 number.
9712,US Airways,@USAirways @PeterPiatetsky Ummmm I think US Air's computers@were@down for hours - my flight is 3 hours Late Flight.
9713,US Airways,"@USAirways comedy of errors continues..."" We can't get into our gate, there is a broken down truck in the way"" #fail"
9714,US Airways,@USAirways Instructions say to CALL. I'm just doing what it said to do.
9715,US Airways,@USairways Since I am a loyal USAir customer I am sure that they will make this up to me-right now I want to get home &amp; back to work.

10325,US Airways,@UsAirways can a real person help me here? This customer service is poor. I'm at the mercy of someone since the flights are disappearing.
10326,US Airways,"@USAirways I intend to..very much. My 4,000 followers will as well."
10327,US Airways,"@USAirways Your customer service is  non-existent/ terrible. Dozens waiting for bags not placed on our flight, no staff anywhere #neveragain"

10329,US Airways,@USAirways @traveloneworld .. Utterly frustrated after 4 hours on hold call was disconnected. I need to amend a Flight Booking Problems. HELP! OW Emerald
10330,US Airways,@USAirways ok thank you! Very helpful! This is why you're my favorite airline!
10331,US Airways,"@USAirways They provided no options. Since you all have a better sense of the weather, I hoped you could suggest."
10332,US Airways,@USAirways you airline is doing rather poor right now. In SLC waiting to take off. Was suppose to take off now 2 hours and 3 minutes ago!
10333,US Airways,@USAirways Get new planes then. Got on this plane at 7:50 its 10:20 now and still on tarmac. How ru going to compensate me for this?

10335,US Airways,@USAirways are you going to do anything to help stranded travelers of flight 680?! No communication from anyone. All of us dumped here.
10336,US Airways,"@USAirways question is why flight took off at all, now a friend is stuck needlessly in another city"
10337,US Airways,@USAirways in a few weeks
10338,US Airways,@USAirways #Wronganswer. Talk is cheap. Customer service is the action of making things right for the customer. #fail again.
10339,US Airways,@USAirways 4 hours . How do I change my flight that was Cancelled Flightled ?
10340,US Airways,@USAirways You won't give us a hotel or food. Can you at least suggestion options for making it to the metro city I have a ticket to?
10341,US Airways,@USAirways actually it landed in BWI 30 minutes ago. She is stranded but I have friends to help. You FAILED big time on this one.
10342,US Airways,@USAirways I have been on hold for over one hour waiting to reschedule a flight. How much longer should I expect?
10343,US Airways,"@USAirways its fine. 

Just wondering where my money went..."
10344,US Airways,@USAirways You landed me at #BWI instead of @Reagan_Airport  and have no plans for me to make it home to DC. How do you suggest I get home?
10345,US Airways,"@USAirways stranded at BWI after two diversions. No cust service, no transport. Dumped here. Terrible customer service!"
10346,US Airways,"@USAirways As a member of the news media, the awful service of the last few days won't go unnoticed."
10347,US Airways,"@USAirways My wife, sick 3yr-old-twins, and I have been waiting in line now for 2hrs to see an agent! Phone agent said nothing til Tuesday!"

10360,US Airways,@USAirways been sitting on the tarmac for 90 mins now bc engine is broken. How are u going to compensate passengers #WorstAirline
10361,US Airways,@USAirways it was your fault the flight was delayed to begin with. I shouldn't have to check my bag if there's a bunch of space
10362,US Airways,@USAirways it is an extreme inconvenience to make ppl check bags when there's a lot of overhead space left. You lie so you're not at fault
10363,US Airways,@USAirways stuck on the runway for 2 hrs 10 min due to weather in PHL. Nowhere can I find accurate info on #558 to BOS
10364,US Airways,@USAirways no more hotel voucher? Everyone had to get one but not me...what do I do? Arrived from Amsterdam #SnowStorm
10365,US Airways,"@USAirways Yep, except this delay was due to a hasty and unwise decision to pushback other plane before the plows were done. #fail."
10366,US Airways,@USAirways by far the worst airline in history. I'll never ever fly your garbage again

10385,US Airways,"@USAirways Can't stress enough how awful the agent was for flight 5283. Knew 11 ppl from delayed flight were on way in mins, no compassion."
10386,US Airways,@USAirways I certainly understand the hold delays for WX reschedules - I've been on for 2hr15min - do you have an estimated wait time?
10387,US Airways,@USAirways And cherry on top-flight 880 was on runway after we landed ON TIME for 45 mins. Still didn't get half the luggage.
10388,US Airways,@USAirways likelihood of PHL to BDL actually leaving tonight? 2 hour delay so far!

10390,US Airways,@USAirways over an hour is unacceptable wait time. thanks for nothing.  Be sure never to fly you again
10391,US Airways,@USAirways Thanks guys! Got hold of someone. Really awesome service I appreciate it :)
10392,US Airways,@USAirways understood. It simply feels as if the staff is not being entirely truthful about the situation.

10402,US Airways,@USAirways That's clever. Its clear you need more agents. 94 min hold and counting. Flex workforces are highly possible in 2015

10416,US Airways,@USAirways Don't want to clog your already-crowded line with a special meal request. Can someone DM me to sort out? #vegetarianproblems :)

10464,US Airways,@USAirways but only for certain flights from CLT-NYC. The notion that you can't rebook customers for 48 hours is absurd.

10646,US Airways,@USAirways So when was I supposed to call the Internet Desk? Especially since my reservation told me to directly call the main 1-800 number?
10647,US Airways,@USAirways Not only did u lose the flight plan! Now ur flight crew is FAA timed out! Thx for havin us sit on the tarmac for an hr! #Pathetic
10648,US Airways,@USAirways I've been on hold for 75 minutes waiting to talk to someone about my flight tomorrow. Is there another number to call?

10650,US Airways,@USAirways hey guys just want to say I had the best flight ever! Thank you so much. I fell asleep and actually had a wet dream.
10651,US Airways,@USAirways Can you help me update KTN on the profile?  Ticket book via AA &amp; that info didn't get pass on.  I've been on hold forever
10652,US Airways,@USAirways so you're not honoring miles with @united that were traveled last year?
10653,US Airways,"@USAirways you need to check information regarding hotels, shuttles, re routing flights, delayed flights"
10654,US Airways,@USAirways I was eventually given a flight to Memphis but only after I was taken off my original flight bc I was checked in as my father
10655,US Airways,@USAirways How the heck does one get the Internet desk to authorize a waiver? Would that involved being on hold for another hour?
10656,US Airways,@USAirways so am I supposed to discuss this matter with a computer? #BadCustomerService #Airlines #DividendRewards
10657,US Airways,"@USAirways &gt;250k miles on usair.  Last four flights not good. Other airlines much improved. Billing issues, seats, legroom, in air service."
10658,US Airways,"@USAirways It says to call. Before connecting, get song, dance about weather. Weather bad 3 days? Called for 2 days before. #wasteoftime"
10659,US Airways,@USAirways REALLY? Tried that already-got message not available to do. Next idea?
10660,US Airways,@USAirways I'm glad you're sorry that I'm homeless for the night. Makes me feel secure.
10661,US Airways,@USAirways but in the meantime I'll be sleeping on a park bench on dadeland st.  Thanks guys!
10662,US Airways,"@USAirways ah, and I was only given one shuttle voucher, so if I do ever get back to the airport you'll be getting the bill"
10663,US Airways,@USAirways wonder if this misery is considered a damage in a breach of contract lawsuit #lawyerup
10664,US Airways,"@USAirways but wait! They are booked, along with all other hotels nearby. I was sent anyway, to the hotel managers disbelief."
10665,US Airways,"@USAirways but don't worry! They found a hotel, it's only 45min away. I got there around 11:30pm, no problem."
10666,US Airways,@USAirways at which point in told they have sold my voucher because I wasn't fast enough
10667,US Airways,"@USAirways the kind gentleman at the gate tells me to ""go left"" to get my hotel voucher at the ticket gate. Took about 20min to get there"
10668,US Airways,@USAirways I have a story for you. It starts with a two hour delayed flight that makes me miss my connection in Miami.
10669,US Airways,@USAirways No worries I was able to read @stephenrodrick entire book while holding. #TheMagicalStranger
10670,US Airways,@USAirways -doing best??? Think not. Lousy way to run an airline. Why no online way to connect? You be on hold for 2hrs &amp; then zip
10671,US Airways,@USAirways flight scheduled for 730pm...told at 150am that flight is Cancelled Flightled after sitting on cold plane for 2 hours.
10672,US Airways,@USAirways refuses to compensate passengers when inconvenienced and wouldn't even rebook me on another airline. #disappointed
10673,US Airways,@USAirways Can you tell me why I waited 90 mins and then was charged the $25 phone change fee even tho I wasn't allow to make change online?
10674,US Airways,@USAirways @stephenrodrick Your team needs to build capacity
10675,US Airways,@USAirways I will write CR. Not sure what good it'll do as the customer service I experienced was horrible.
10676,US Airways,@USAirways -1st x told no travel advisory-now TWO hrs on hold &amp; disconnected. Fl from BHM to Charlotte to PHL won't go-HELP!!!

10683,US Airways,@USAirways us air should be ashamed of this service - on hold for hours? No help from any representative just to reschedule due to weather ?
10684,US Airways,"@usairways now on hold for an hour. So frustrating, I suspect you have more operators come in on days like this w/inclement weather?"
10685,US Airways,"@USAirways - the worst! Hold time crazy, agents horrible, no accountability! #USAIRsucks"

10701,US Airways,@USAirways you can thank supervisor Jeanine and her coworkers for the excellent customer service they provided
10702,US Airways,@USAirways only sympathy she offered was holding a reservation until Monday night. That's pretty awesome if you ask me...
10703,US Airways,@USAirways express my disappointment in your reservation department and the treatment of a Sailor dealing with a death in the family
10704,US Airways,@USAirways that's who I spoke to already. We've already booked another flight w/someone else. Thanks for your concern. Just wanted to
10705,US Airways,@USAirways talked to Supervisor Jeanine and she couldn't help me. 45 minutes of talking to her and nothing.
10706,US Airways,@USAirways i thought @united was the worst airline but nah. You guys are far worse. Is @Delta the only decent airline out there?
10707,US Airways,"@USAirways @keithlaw  I flew US Air for the first time yesterday, got propositioned by the flight attendant....true story!  #Creditcardsales"
10708,US Airways,@USAirways 13 years of Naval Service and I run the travel department for all my commands...

10710,US Airways,@USAirways Already tried. How about Conf # via DM
10711,US Airways,"@USAirways new slogan should be ""if you don't want to arrive on time, pick us"""

10717,US Airways,@usairways Need to change div miles ticket after travel started due to weather advisory. Told not possible unless flight Cancelled Flightled. AnyHelp?
10718,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir I was supposed to get from fresno to pittsburgh by 10pm.  Instead I'm now not getting in until 4pm... tomorrow
10719,US Airways,"@USAirways @AmericanAir I'm stuck in the airport in fresno trying to beat the storm to pittsburgh, and you guys have offered nothing. HORRID"
10720,US Airways,@USAirways hello I have a question for you and your phone lines have jammed
10721,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir u are the worst airline ever figure out the merger #dontmakemegooutside
10722,US Airways,@USAirways Just to follow up here is my experience: http://t.co/WJIiGZtiwg
10723,US Airways,@USAirways / @AmericanAir are incompetent.
10724,US Airways,@USAirways Now the next plane had a broken seat!  My row!  Another hour delay!  #mad
10725,US Airways,"@USAirways how can I make a purchase, you take the money but I don't have a reservation...Explain"

10729,US Airways,@USAirways  2 hours on hold and issue still not resolved. hope to make my flight in 12 hours. for every minute of talk = 20 minutes of hold
10730,US Airways,@USAirways connection made. Thanks again this week. #daddyshome
10731,US Airways,@USAirways worst customer service experience ever today. Get it together.
10732,US Airways,@USAirways I know some folks have to use your airlines but doesn't customer service ever matter? I really hate to complain but it's brutal!
10733,US Airways,@USAirways im on the plane not sure what you mean. We are sitting here. It's just one story of failure after another when I fly you guys
10734,US Airways,@USAirways still waiting #brokenpromises #notnice #neveragain #tellyourstory
10735,US Airways,@USAirways your team was just terrifyingly rude to a young mother &amp; her baby trying to check in to a flight from PHX to JWA. Help her out.
10736,US Airways,@USAirways them and @AmericanAir
10737,US Airways,@USAirways rudest crew member experience! Throwing shade and calling out customers. #reachingnewlows
10738,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir terminal E in Miami is still the worst most smelly airport ever. Thanks for nothing.
10739,US Airways,@USAirways I did &amp; was told I asked to many questions. bag might still be on flight 413. Should be easy to check when it lands in Seattle.
10740,US Airways,@USAirways Cancelled Flightled our original flight to aruba. Now on the way home we were told we don't have seats. Never flying @usairways again
10741,US Airways,@USAirways here we go again. Same flight as last week. Delayed already 45 mins. Think the 7:15 can leave PHL before 1:15 am? #waitingagain
10742,US Airways,@USAirways it's not misjudging it's a deliberate strategy. Seen it multiple times on USAir. Makes staff life easier at expens of passengers
10743,US Airways,@USAirways - delayed 1851. Need an extra 5 min to make 1769. Would appreciate a little help again this week.
10744,US Airways,@USAirways stuck on Tarmac for hour an a half and told longer to go and no hotels available when we land in Phoenix #unacceptable #unhappy
10745,US Airways,@USAirways not happening #worstairlineever also Marie Burroughs is the worst customer service rep ever #yourairlinesucks
10746,US Airways,@USAirways technical issues = inefficient computer triage system. Personality/ compassion of operators = not. Sad example of sad company.
10747,US Airways,@USAirways you suck and you ruined my day. And my vacation isn't even until June.
10748,US Airways,"@USAirways will do.  maybe the pre-purchase meal email is because the flight is 9 min short of 3 hours, so I guess there are none offered"
10749,US Airways,"@USAirways yep, check it and my gmail 'Promotions' folder regularly... :-("
10750,US Airways,@USAirways  is a bag that is   23‚ÄùL x 9‚ÄùW x 12‚ÄùH  allowed as a carry on?
10751,US Airways,@USAirways thanks for nothing
10752,US Airways,@USAirways there is nothing tonight and I am on the flight now with GOGO internet is there a way that someone could send me a DM or email?
10753,US Airways,@USAirways 2 bad planes &amp; 3 gate changes= lots of exercise. #travelfail let's hope this plane works. I'm tired.
10754,US Airways,"@USAirways Good info, but am already signed up for all options.  None of which sound like they applied to the 'missing' emails."
10755,US Airways,@usairways is there not a faster way to get me to Columbia Sc than making me stay in CLT over night after my delayed flight?
10756,US Airways,@USAirways thank you
10757,US Airways,@usairways and @american please get my plane together before I go to Jetblue
10758,US Airways,"@USAirways it MIGHT have went through. No confirmation. ""Please wait"" then same form."
10759,US Airways,"@USAirways found the tix#, security code not working. Tried a dozen times."
10760,US Airways,"@USAirways Nightmarish customer service. Further to that, as an elite member, I'm appalled."
10761,US Airways,@USAirways I have never been given a number for elite for usair. Only AA. I waited for 3 hours for an answer and by then my seat was gone.
10762,US Airways,@USAirways if you get my bag from E Gate to B Gate at the Charlotte airport before my 6 pm flight (Late Flight cause of yall) I‚Äôll ride US for life
10763,US Airways,"@USAirways It's a debit card, but I am a Dividend member."

10773,US Airways,@USAirways Used 2 get emails 1) pre-purchase a snack and 2) when time to check in. Got neither 4 tomorrow's trip. Do they not get sent now?
10774,US Airways,@USAirways link didn't work via Mobil.
10775,US Airways,@USAirways Wishing we had our luggage. 2 days now. Had to pay our way from St Thomas to San Juan. Spent extra $$$ because of this mess up.

10785,US Airways,@USAirways I keep calling your help line (800) 428-4322 and it keeps saying they are too busy to help &amp; to call back Late Flightr. FOR A WEEK NOW!
10786,US Airways,@USAirways who would like to watch the video of how loyal customers are really treated while asking for an explanation for our 6 hour delay?
10787,US Airways,"@USAirways more lies, they said in their email we were delayed due to weather when the sky was clear in the city we were departing."
10788,US Airways,"@USAirways I'm enjoying my flights so far! You're doing a great job. Today's been tough, so thanks for making my flights comfortable."
10789,US Airways,@USAirways look @Delta has made the right call on CHO. Please evaluate. http://t.co/3KhGjoFgpX
10790,US Airways,@USAirways That's not the question. Question is: how do I get past the computer fastest if we both know that the computer can't help me?
10791,US Airways,@USAirways if I have Dividend Miles credit card &amp; I used it to book my flight is one bag free?
10792,US Airways,@USAirways have checked all day.  CHO needs added.  Please evaluate.

10800,US Airways,@nrhodes85: look! Another apology. DO NOT FLY @USAirways
10801,US Airways,@USAirways it's painful being on hold to you!! Really 25 minutes to change a flight!! http://t.co/ocqk0JFXuA
10802,US Airways,"@usairways yep, sent my bag to Philadelphia instead of Miami...I caught it...then was told my flight changed to tomorrow, wrong again #fail"
10803,US Airways,@USAirways will shall see in the next couple of minutes.
10804,US Airways,"@USAirways right, can you use a shuttle ticket from LGA to BOS for any shuttle flight? Probably gonna miss the 4pm."
10805,US Airways,"@USAirways I did, but i need to get a human being. What's the fastest way to achieve this? All I get is a computer."
10806,US Airways,@USAirways - Check-in staff at PHX are awesome! Great traffic control for general boarding.

10809,US Airways,"@USAirways &amp; also that I was told no comps, upgrades, etc. ReFlight Booking Problems is good enough. #usairwaysfail"
10810,US Airways,"@USAirways I was... 4 tomorrow. I missed my meeting today, &amp; it was pointless 2 pay hotel today when the purpose of my trip has been screwed"
10811,US Airways,@USAirways Merging AA and DividendMiles yield an error. What are the _exact_ steps to navigate the phone menu? All I get is a computer.
10812,US Airways,@USAirways #2066. Was on plane from PBI to CLT and knew about the frozen water. Also saw a plane to NYC take off at the gate next door!
10813,US Airways,"@USAirways and next flight delayed as well. 5238 out of Charlotte, is it just my luck or what?"
10814,US Airways,@USAirways   Just talked to reservation. Must congratulation to them. Very friendly.  Good for usair. The ONLY airline we fly.
10815,US Airways,@USAirways I am just trying to establish what your policy is. Thanks!
10816,US Airways,"@USAirways fight was delayed 3 hrs in MCO, now I'm stuck in Philly with a standby ticket, flight 4009. Solution needed."
10817,US Airways,@USAirways sure did. I have carried this bag on numerous times on the same style plane. Planning accordingly apparently accounts for nothing
10818,US Airways,@USAirways Know what I like about gate 35X @NationalAirpor ? Nothin.I like nothin bout yo #ghettofab gate #USAirways http://t.co/mAqw2nLNiU
10819,US Airways,@USAirways I've tried calling 3 times the past 3 days and I keep getting told to call back. SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME
10820,US Airways,@USAirways gate agent in CLT forced me to check bag in z1 &amp; proceeded to allow larger bags. Huge inconvenience to travel plans.

10824,US Airways,"@USAirways see? No response? Obviously you think this ""service"" is acceptable. #customerservicefail"
10825,US Airways,"‚Äú@USAirways: We're sincerely sorry, Sean. Reservations is working hard to answer everyone's call and we appreciate your patience.‚Äù #false"
10826,US Airways,@USAirways absolutely
10827,US Airways,@USAirways It wasn't weather this morning.  AWE1701 diverted back to BOS due to mechanical issues.  So far lost one of 3 days :(
10828,US Airways,@USAirways I have been in contact with 3 people and still no answers. You keep sending me to @Expedia and they keep sending me to you!
10829,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir no one appreciates the sass of the gate agent at Gate C38 at LGA flight US626. Irritated customers
10830,US Airways,@USAirways how do I get you to stop sending me emails about my ex boyfriends account? I don't care how many points he has! He only has

10833,US Airways,@USAirways awesome! Flight #676 out of philly on Tuesday. Party in row 15 if you're interested.
10834,US Airways,@USAirways flight is already over. I think the airline should just have the flight attendants actually emphasize that VAPE is still smoking
10835,US Airways,@USAirways Call volumes are high so the best answer is to hang up on me?
10836,US Airways,@USAirways i got through and am able to switch my flight with no charge. Thank you
10837,US Airways,@USAirways will you please start offering more routes out of @triflight to more locations instead of just charlotte and atlanta
10838,US Airways,"@USAirways Welcome to North Texas US Air / American Air employees.

10839,US Airways,@USAirways oh they saw it and said nothing.
10840,US Airways,@USAirways yes but lost a whole day.  Frustrating!!  #poor customer service
10841,US Airways,@USAirways Saddens me that my first tweet - ever - has to be a complaint about customer service.
10842,US Airways,"@USAirways trying to check in online for a flight tomorrow.  Tried computer, tablet, and phone.  got error message on all devices?"
10843,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir How do I merge my miles accounts? Your sites tell me my info don't match even though I can't find a difference.

10849,US Airways,@USAirways what is your policy around bringing a breast pump on board?
10850,US Airways,"@USAirways Thanks. No DC yet, I see. I will keep that link and check back. Appreciate it!"
10851,US Airways,@USAirways I'm glad too. But I should not have to spend an hour to try and track down the basic information that you already have available.
10852,US Airways,@USAirways Will you guys be offering no-fee changes for flights out of DCA tomorrow afternoon?
10853,US Airways,@USAirways how can i get ahold of a reservations supervisor?
10854,US Airways,@USAirways I called the BTV desk; they had more information - so it exists.  Your systems don't make it easy for the customer to access it.
10855,US Airways,"@USAirways awesome! And yes, @UpInAirClaire is!"
10856,US Airways,@USAirways that website does not give correct info said my bag was in Miami was in key west the entire time..I got the run around for 2 days

10876,US Airways,@USAirways what is happening with flight 1701 from BOS to PHL? Daughter and her fianc√©e are stuck in BOS!
10877,US Airways,"@nrhodes85 isn't it funny that @USAirways just apologizes, but doesn't actually take steps 2 go above &amp; beyond for customers? #NotImpressed"
10878,US Airways,"@USAirways 2133. Flight now Cancelled Flightled. Have been rebooked on 2pm flight. If on time take off, I'll have spent 5 extra hours at DCA."
10879,US Airways,"@USAirways We've been sitting on this plane for almost an hour, waiting for it to be fueled. Shouldn't that have been done b4 we got on????"
10880,US Airways,@USAirways Thank you
10881,US Airways,@USAirways can I get a free mimosa to compensate my flight delay (yet again) thx
10882,US Airways,@USAirways Reservation agent on the phone did a great job.

10886,US Airways,"@USAirways I've been on hold for 35 mins to sort out my reservation out of sync message when trying to check in, what's wrong?!?"
10887,US Airways,@USAirways Thank you. But I don‚Äôt understand. What will you do with my feedback?
10888,US Airways,"@USAirways has no idea what customer service means.  As the customer, if you mess up my plans, don't treat me like its no big deal!"
10889,US Airways,@USAirways Still on hold. 1 hour and 45 minutes and counting. Platinum? Who cares? Problems checking in? Who cares?
10890,US Airways,@USAirways how about a little help for the two gate agents trying to rebook flight 1707?
10891,US Airways,@USAirways I respect the stress of a merger but one rep to reschedule/replane 15 ppl who are already Late Flight? #youcandobetter
10892,US Airways,"@USAirways now I am on flight to FLL, and told to take a train back to PBI to get my car. There are no trains to PBI!"
10893,US Airways,"@USAirways I fly quite a bit, and it's not difficult to communicate. If agents let people know what's happening, arrangements can be made"
10894,US Airways,"@USAirways Handled on the phone. Unfortunately it wiped out an entire trip, which is why I'm so displeased."
10895,US Airways,@USAirways headed to NYC from CLT. Funny to hear all phones ring at once and then the entire plane groan (has happened twice more).
10896,US Airways,@USAirways made it!!! Send Bloody Mary's to row 27!!!
10897,US Airways,"@USAirways 5223 out of Gainesville, FL"

10900,US Airways,@USAirways the flights weren't from this morning... It was 4 flights 2 on Thursday and 2 on Monday which turned into Tuesday
10901,US Airways,@USAirways I spoke with a customer service rep who was rude and curt and transferred me to eternal hold. Sad. #badservice #mergerdisaster
10902,US Airways,@USAirways your customer service is a nightmare. I have been on hold for 1 hour. I'm a platinum member with AA and feel like it's worthless
10903,US Airways,"@USAirways never let's me down, every. Single. Flight. Gets delayed."
10904,US Airways,@USAirways sitting on the ground in Charlotte with no gate or comms for flight deck great happy Friday hope i make my connection

10906,US Airways,@USAirways made it.. Never ran so fast in my life
10907,US Airways,@USAirways I've been standing on a very crowded bus for the past 30 mins for DCA-PIT. HELP! @AmericanAir http://t.co/jasKYPLWt5
10908,US Airways,"@USAirways Thanks, but you can't. My flight was Cancelled Flightled for ""maintenance"" reasons, and the next available flight was too Late Flight for me."
10909,US Airways,"@USAirways yes, I was rebooked the next day (Weds). Thanks. Just upset that I lost 2 additional work days AND paid for my own hotel. #losing"
10910,US Airways,@USAirways call Gate D9 in CLT and get me on this flight
10911,US Airways,@USAirways suppose I need to tweet everyone how horrible your airline is for you to take notice. Let me try that route.
10912,US Airways,"@USAirways 835, fix this ASAP"
10913,US Airways,"@USAirways No. Just felt that you could do better in making the emails feel a little less of ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt care. We‚Äôre automated."""
10914,US Airways,"@USAirways @AmericanAir , you Cancelled Flightled my flight back during the holidays and gave me a refund of $8.51/ticket from PHL to EWR, really?!"
10915,US Airways,@USAirways I'm logged into a Flight Booking Problems. I need to add API before travelling to the states but I cannot see where to do it

10922,US Airways,@USAirways it would be nice to just pull up to the gate. Still sitting here
10923,US Airways,@usairways app is the worst one for airlines. Can't do anything once your original flight time has gone by. Useless.
10924,US Airways,@USAirways has completely wasted my work day! Thank you for the bad service and bad Friday!
10925,US Airways,"@USAirways And also, it's great that you tweet @ complainers, but what about the in-person help when I need it? Robyn F. in Manch = useless."
10926,US Airways,.@USAirways You'll be receiving a long &amp; detailed complaint letter soon. Long story short: never flying USAir again.
10927,US Airways,"@Usairways thanks for making miss connection, getting rebooked, missing that too, and a miserable day. Started my day @ 4:30am for nothing!"
10928,US Airways,"@Usairways need to learn operations. Sit a plane overnight at #gsp, and not realize there's a mech problem. Then delay flight 3 1/2 hours!"
10929,US Airways,"@USAirways that the flight was delayed &amp; closed the doors only to tell us we would not be leaving for an hour and a half. Bad, bad service"
10930,US Airways,@USAirways why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the gate
10931,US Airways,@USAirways He overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled. You should refund me I had no Choice. #Grossedout
10932,US Airways,@USAirways I appreciate your prompt response.
10933,US Airways,@USAirways nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay for Choice
10934,US Airways,@USAirways well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on.
10935,US Airways,@USAirways I did not want to hang out on your plane all day when I am traveling to get work done and turn right back around. Unacceptable
10936,US Airways,@USAirways doesn't seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn't help #usairwaysfail
10937,US Airways,@USAirways this is a complete waste of my day. A trip to my for work has now turned into sitting on your planes all day. Ridiculous
10938,US Airways,@USAirways we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight.
10939,US Airways,@USAirways the plane is moving and it's no ice. We are moving to the end of the runway to sit because LGA has one runway open.
10940,US Airways,@USAirways of course weather was a joke 43 beats 5 degrees in PHL! ‚õÑÔ∏è‚òÄÔ∏è
10941,US Airways,@USAirways  nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay.
10942,US Airways,@USAirways is setting themselves up for a lawsuit. No way we should sit on a plane for an hour and a half.
10943,US Airways,@USAirways Thks US #1786 2/19 PHL to FLL. Overall 1st class has improved with more food now on PHL to FLL and most crews are super.
10944,US Airways,@USAirways I want to not sit on a plane from DCA to LGA for an hour and a half which is longer than my flight.
10945,US Airways,@USAirways this is so unacceptable. I'm going for the day. Now most of my day will be sitting on your plane. Not to mention there is no air
10946,US Airways,@USAirways is moving the plane to the end of the runway for us to sit on it for an hour and a half. They didn't even let us off.
10947,US Airways,@USAirways hi is there somebody avail who can help .....with an refund ? its unbelievable on the phone w US for more than 7 hrs in 4 days
10948,US Airways,@USAirways Plus a US Airways - you need to do something about this! I left Philly to thaw out!!!! http://t.co/pKy7ZhnNRH
10949,US Airways,@USAirways ordered a Scotch &amp; water and F/A asked if I wanted full glass or half? 60 yrs old and first time ever asked that????
10950,US Airways,"@USAirways yeah, the mark was like a mile back. Also we're an hour Late Flight. So thanks a ton for the great service today."
10951,US Airways,@USAirways we got 1 drink then F/A sat in jump seat doing crosswords. Glasses picked up at landing. Just a very lazy service 4 First class.
10952,US Airways,"@USAirways Paid for a Choice Seat my Choice is to NOT have big man next to me in my seat, too. #oldseatnocushion #worstflight #nohelponboard"
10953,US Airways,@USAirways First class no snack basket was catered so drinks only No preflight drink or coathanging 1st drink service 50 min after take off
10954,US Airways,"@USAirways you told us last night that there was a ground stop at O'Hare FOUR HOURS AFTER Obama landed, stop blaming someone else"
10955,US Airways,@USAirways #428 delayed due to #frozentoilet #medicalissue #mechanicalissue #dispatchissue We've heard it all! #LetsGo
10956,US Airways,"@USAirways ""Able""? Does that mean not having private conversations and not helping those w/ luggage that won't fit overhead?"
10957,US Airways,@USAirways 1826 trying to make a connection to Punta Cana leave PHL at 9:50
10958,US Airways,@USAirways is the worst. 45 minute delay in Boston. Not weather reLate Flightd. Going to miss our connecting flight. Gassing up the plane issue.
10959,US Airways,@USAirways is the worst!! Still haven't left.. Everyone missing connections.
10960,US Airways,@USAirways today's flight to Philadelphia.  It's a little disappointing for the unnecessary delays and it's not even snowing in FL.
10961,US Airways,@USAirways I have been trying to book a flight using my miles for 3 straight days. 210 min on phone - still haven't talked to a human.
10962,US Airways,@USAirways can you help me reroute my trip?
10963,US Airways,@USAirways gonna miss connecting flight.. Delayed flying out of Boston
10964,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir I'm in the #finalstretch to #chairman #execplat #mileagerun for 6k needed any suggestions? #letsgo!
10965,US Airways,@USAirways on flight 1839 waiting for weight and balance info for the past 30 minutes!!!
10966,US Airways,@USAirways thank you for refunding me on my baggage ! really appreciate it
10967,US Airways,@USAirways thanks for taking my flight off the board AND NOT PROVIDING and updates about my flight which is 26 minutes Late Flight.
10968,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir I am so going to miss US Airways.  You always provided great service and NEVER LET ME DOWN.
10969,US Airways,@USAirways NEVER AGAIN! Worse experience in my life. http://t.co/3dDQq0gQni
10970,US Airways,.@USAirways I rebooked myself - but Cancelled Flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable. You started delaying at 1:30pm.
10971,US Airways,"@USAirways 7+ hrs stranded in DCA...zero apologies and the worst customer service. Been a faithful traveler for 15+ years, but no more!"
10972,US Airways,@USAirways this response doesn't correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated
10973,US Airways,@USAirways been at DCA at 5 pm still here at 3 am due to mechanical issues and lack of snacks on the plane! Absolutely worse experience!
10974,US Airways,"@USAirways it was 1838, almost 5 hours Late Flight due  to mechanical."
10975,US Airways,"@USAirways never flying #USAirways again. Horrible experience, terrible customer service."
10976,US Airways,@USAirways Mobile boarding pass email.
10977,US Airways,@USAirways we will...sunday! Just a few days away
10978,US Airways,@USAirways I am following you now
10979,US Airways,@USAirways unacceptable. You knew the pilot wouldn't be able to complete the trip. Wasted all of our time.
10980,US Airways,@USAirways I have been on three planes for flight 1907 and still haven't left the ground BAD SERVICE #sad
10981,US Airways,@USAirways Then told to offload because the captain was over hours? This has been a terrible experience.
10982,US Airways,"@USAirways Why were we loaded onto the plane (4 hours Late Flight, mind you), made to sit for 40 minutes"
10983,US Airways,@USAirways why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period? Unacceptable.
10984,US Airways,@USAirways offloading the plane?!?!?! This is ridiculous!!!!
10985,US Airways,"‚Äú@USAirways: @jdbwaffles We're excited to have you fly with us, JB! When will this be?‚Äù Spring Break !!!"
10986,US Airways,@USAirways still just sitting here. nobody has said anything. What's up?
10987,US Airways,@USAirways that is actually not true! You can get a seat online after a big hassle. That policy is totally dishonest and misleading. #FAA
10988,US Airways,@USAirways I will. Thank you for at least tweeting me back:) better than most. üëå
10989,US Airways,@USAirways that seems unlikely without a crew here to board us
10990,US Airways,"@USAirways that's incorrect. Four people, last flight of the night, with our bags. #horriblecustomerservice"
10991,US Airways,@USAirways Exicted to be flying with y'all soon !!
10992,US Airways,@USAirways and that you can choose the same seat for free after clicking 100 buttons.
10993,US Airways,"@USAirways the fact that you are making customers pay $15 to ""choose"" a seat and try to convince them using psychological tricks with colors"
10994,US Airways,@USAirways I‚Äôll do that in addition to reviewing on my blog. Your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than :/
10995,US Airways,@USAirways your new seat assignment service is an embarrassment to airlines and customers worldwide. #shameonyou #usairwayssucks
10996,US Airways,@USAirways worst experience ever with you guys‚Ä¶see my blog tomorrow on my experience. Maybe you can help make it better.
10997,US Airways,@USAirways now the freezing bus is just doing circles?
10998,US Airways,"@USAirways please explain, I have plenty of time since I'm STRANDED!!"
10999,US Airways,"@USAirways I doubt that, its 11:21p &amp; we r still being held captive on the ground at DCA! A little communication from up front would b nice."
11000,US Airways,@USAirways why does it cost $900 to change a $100 ticket when it only cost $150 to purchase a new ticket?
11001,US Airways,@USAirways 3935. Sitting on a freezing bus because nobody is in the plane. What is up?
11002,US Airways,@USAirways we already spoke to someone several times about the matter and no one is sympathetic or will fly us home early complimentary.
11003,US Airways,@USAirways doesn't want me to get home
11004,US Airways,"@USAirways They don't stand alone for me, I bought tix based on USAir confirmed flight. What good is confirmation if you change it anyway?"
11005,US Airways,"@USAirways DCA-&gt;HPN, u r prof hostage takers.We stood on bus 2 plane for 25 min,now sitting on plane with no mvmt &amp; 1 announcement 4 &gt; hour!"
11006,US Airways,"@USAirways - I bet you don't, but I'm the paying customer here. I know how to check for flight delays, thank you."
11007,US Airways,"@USAirways I can't even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive, forcing me to purchase a new ticket."
11008,US Airways,@USAirways oh great after a 5 hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving.  Flight 1137 has been awful
11009,US Airways,@USAirways that's the 1st sorry I received from your company. The least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge.
11010,US Airways,@USAirways never flying with you guys again. Extremely disorganized and too many delays.
11011,US Airways,"@USAirways my buddies are currently delayed 3.5 hours and counting in DCA on their ways to CAE for a golf week, any compensation? #FlyDelta"
11012,US Airways,"@USAirways Flights 890 was the delay, Flight 5136 was my missed connection‚Ä¶ Help!"
11013,US Airways,@USAirways the flight that I did not connect to was 1857.
11014,US Airways,@USAirways even when I do simple google search by flight number it tells me which gate so won't be that difficult am sure #disappointed
11015,US Airways,@USAirways yes .not sure how you guys don't know gate is occupied and keep us waiting
11016,US Airways,"@USAirways Wow! Your miles program is Ripoff,Quick ticket fee 75$ I hope you all end up on unemployment."
11017,US Airways,@USAirways - BOS -&gt; DCA delayed again. This needs to stop. I will be filing complaints with the FAA and Consumer Affairs
11018,US Airways,@USAirways sitting on the Tarmac waiting to deplane 40+ minutes. The level of service I've come to expect.
11019,US Airways,@USAirways you gladly take the loyal customer's money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused.
11020,US Airways,@USAirways the least you could do is make up for what you have caused. You are ruining people's memories! You should be ashamed!
11021,US Airways,"@USAirways 1st a Late Flight plane, then missing flight crew, then maintenance problems, gates switched 4 times. You call this customer service??"
11022,US Airways,"@USAirways due to your expensive change fees either. Out of all the airlines, we chose yours, all do you could screw us. STRANDED!! No help!"
11023,US Airways,"@USAirways we can't afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home, turns out we can't afford to go home."
11024,US Airways,"@USAirways but it's not their fault, because their policy says they at least got us to our destination. Really?"
11025,US Airways,"@USAirways ruined our honeymoon by causing us to miss our international flight, and now we are stranded."
11026,US Airways,@USAirways FA attendant on 4553 PHL to PWM tonight was fab!  An asset to your team.  From 1F. Have a great night team!
11027,US Airways,@USAirways thanks for overFlight Booking Problems first class and automatically downgrading my upgrade 3 min before boarding. #ffstatusdontmatter #thenewaa
11028,US Airways,@USAirways We're having 2 grandbabies in 2 weeks -- will travel to DC for the births. Thank you for the reasonable fares!  See you Saturday!
11029,US Airways,"@USAirways Thank you, @USAirways!  Your fare to from DTW to DCA was much lower than @Delta and @SouthwestAir!  Thank you! You won me over!"
11030,US Airways,@USAirways flight 728 from PHL to London has been sitting on the tarmac for 46min w/NO further update from the pilot. what gives???
11031,US Airways,"@USAirways I already HAVE, four times"
11032,US Airways,"@USAirways 42 minutes holding. Seriously, if your average wait time is over 30 minutes then maybe, just maybe, you're understaffed."
11033,US Airways,@USAirways I submitted refund request b4 1st flight 2 days ago. Is that all I need 2 do?
11034,US Airways,"@USAirways I know that, thanks. Evaluate further ;-) ... -Chairman"
11035,US Airways,"@USAirways Seriously??? I have shared my concerns four times already, to NO avail!  Geeeeezzzzz! #frustrated flyer"
11036,US Airways,@USAirways No hot food on a 5 hour flight? Crazy. Couldn't eat in PHL b/c our original connection was 40 min Late Flight. What gives? #PHLtoLAS
11037,US Airways,"@USAirways Seriously, flight delay Cinci to Philly due to new ground staff, miss connection to MAN UK and now have to argue for hotel. WTF"
11038,US Airways,@USAirways thank you for continuing to be the worst airline out. Didn't need that extra hour of sleep after 29 hours of travel anyway
11039,US Airways,"@USAirways I guess they only respond to compliments. Sorry, can't think@of even ONE."
11040,US Airways,@USAirways  #USAirways disappoints AGAIN! #Cancelled Flighted flights #Missed appointments #Promised refund is a lie
11041,US Airways,@USAirways 45 minutes on hold waiting to speak with an agent !! Come on #USAirways !!! Ridiculous #baggagelost #usairways
11042,US Airways,"@USAirways unable to locate baggage, this is frustrating. All my sons clothes and needs in it. #zfv #yyz #usairways #baggagelost"
11043,US Airways,"@USAirways I already did. My question is, why does it still say in progress on @AskPayPal? It's been 6 days."
11044,US Airways,"@USAIRWAYS ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? Bad customer service, folks. Flew from PSP to PHX flight 2692 on 2/19. (cont) http://t.co/KigfKVXxDQ"
11045,US Airways,@USAirways thanks for getting me rescheduled on a direct flight to NOLA tonight in 10 minutes--and hopefully an hour earlier getting there!
11046,US Airways,@USAirways problem with flight in Gainesville US Airways  5137 to CLT will miss connecting flight 5547 to IAD. When can I get another flight
11047,US Airways,@USAirways still no rep can talk 3 days Late Flightr. U r asking me to checkin to my flight tmrw and my refund is being requested.  Deal w this!!
11048,US Airways,"@USAirways flight 1777 has been waiting for 30 minutes at RSW waiting for weight balance clearance. Come on, let us leave!"
11049,US Airways,"@USAirways @AskPayPal When will it be marked ""completed"". I'm scared I'm going to lose my reservation or my money is going to be refunded."
11050,US Airways,"@USAirways @AskPayPal completed. If that's the case then why does it still say ""in progress"" on Paypal's website. I reserved on the 13th."
11051,US Airways,@USAirways @AskPayPal So I contacted my bank. They took the money out today. I also contacted @USAirways they said my reservation is
11052,US Airways,"@USAirways Appreciate the calls when flight's delayed, but the recorded msg is tedious &amp; just goes on &amp; on. I vote for texts if practical :)"
11053,US Airways,@USAirways HORRIBLE communication on delayed flight out of LGA!!!! I got 2 emails in seconds w different delay times!!!! HORRIBLE
11054,US Airways,@USAirways thank you finally got our bag. Customer services reps were wonderful.
11055,US Airways,"@USAirways Have a 6:05pm flight out of PHL Sat, 2/21. Snow expected. Are we able to switch to an earlier flight without penalty?"
11056,US Airways,@USAirways we got our bags today. Thanks!
11057,US Airways,@USAirways 45 min hold time then a hang up by Manager Mike in dividend miles dept. tough to justify sticking with the Us air CC and status.
11058,US Airways,@USAirways never fails to disappoint.
11059,US Airways,@USAirways platinum flyer bought tkt in AA. Also both accounts are linked. So WHY can't I check in for flight tomorrow?
11060,US Airways,@UsAirways  your person taking tickets is rude and now we are delayed 4-50 minutes because you overfilled fuel on the plane #500.
11061,US Airways,"@USAirways flight 500 out of Seattle has 10,000lbs too much fuel and no water for the lavoratories. Nice job guys - est 40min behind now"
11062,US Airways,@USAirways flight 437 PHX&gt;ORD.  Lead FA Bill is the most professional FA I have seen in 9 years of flying USAir. I have no AB cards. :-(
11063,US Airways,@USAirways I miss you too. Work has taken me out of Philly. I‚Äôve been on flight 1776 from BOS ‚Äî&gt; PHL so many times I should have a res. seat
11064,US Airways,"@USAirways http://t.co/AXRYeIWzh0, vuelo24.es, vuelos24.es sell too cheap MAD-NYC with USAirways. Are they trusted webs or is it a scam?"
11065,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir Total lack of cust. service for a mom flying solo w. baby. Will not be flying w. Am. Air again!!!
11066,US Airways,@USAirways pure anarchy on flight 555 to SLC. People walking in with nothing packed in bags with arms full of stuff. #getittogether
11067,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir you know...hockey sticks are expensive. Your baggage handlers shouldn't just be throwing them on the cart.
11068,US Airways,@USAirways no problem.  Things worked out at airport.   Thanks!
11069,US Airways,@USAirways any word on whether or not flight 1971 from Seattle to Charlotte will have connections held? Or...
11070,US Airways,@USAirways please change direct flights from RIC to JFK instead of LGA. Pleeeeease! LGA is the pits.
11071,US Airways,@USAirways i tried it but doesnt help very much and Reservation seems to be overwhelmed with some issues
11072,US Airways,@USAirways should take a lesson from @SouthwestAir and wait for passengers from connecting flights. Shame..
11073,US Airways,@USAirways Do you have a phone Nbr for Refund Dept ?
11074,US Airways,@USAirways do you post travel alerts on your website? Traveling to Bdl on Sunday morning.
11075,US Airways,"@USAirways yes, it's a domestic flight. Thank you!"
11076,US Airways,@USAirways can I bring a copy or photo of my baby's birth certificate for the flight? I feel uncomfortable traveling with the real thing.
11077,US Airways,@USAirways would like to see you do similar in PHL! http://t.co/n9vGe2nPIB
11078,US Airways,@USAirways thanks! Made it safely! http://t.co/KCqeBEej7S
11079,US Airways,@USAirways they say connections are good still...but another reFlight Booking Problems is the last thing I need today
11080,US Airways,@USAirways tells me to talk to @AmericanAir about my delayed flights. AA tells me to talk to US. #ihatemergers
11081,US Airways,@USAirways what is the holdup? Should I be looking for another flight?
11082,US Airways,@USAirways this is going to take up to an hour--not okay USAir. Not okay. This is ruining everything.
11083,US Airways,@USAirways 4420 delayed further?
11084,US Airways,@USAirways 25+ min. Hung up. Always awful having to call Reservations there.
11085,US Airways,.@USAirways I guess from now on I should take my chances &amp; keep the $50 for the courtesy free because it seems cabin is always full.
11086,US Airways,@USAirways 4 hours Late Flightr And i lost my conection üò°
11087,US Airways,"@USAirways just heard #Monterey airport was closed due to thick fog, any updates"
11088,US Airways,@USAirways over 15min hold on your reservation line. embarrassing. AA Platinum member.
11089,US Airways,"@USAirways - love the changes in the lounge - cheese, veggies, olives in addition to the crackers and snack mix,"
11090,US Airways,@USAirways thanks.  If you have another method also that would be nice.  Appears to be a design flaw
11091,US Airways,@USAirways yes.  Every one of these on every flight is like this.  There needs to be more Velcro or something
11092,US Airways,@USAirways please secure the 'footrest' shelf' in business class on A330 airplanes!!! http://t.co/ZL4bVEXmcJ
11093,US Airways,@USAirways forgetting to fuel up? Realizing there was more cargo to add to plane? One way to try and mask a delay.
11094,US Airways,"@USAirways Your gate team are polite. But your planes are habitually Late Flight. In many cases, passengers are waiting for the flight crew!"
11095,US Airways,@USAirways FUK U US AIRWAYS WITH YO SHITTY CHICKEN SALAD SANDWICH THAT SO OVERPRICED AND U FUKING MAKE ME WAIT IN A 6 HR LAYOVER FUK U AND
11096,US Airways,@USAirways $75 for that uncertainty? I know u run an account; u don't create policy. But it's an undue penalty for a job req'ing flexibility
11097,US Airways,@USAirways is there  anyway to get rebook in help on twitter?
11098,US Airways,@USAirways why are you letting us go to the runway if there are mechanical problems. #wewantcomps
11099,US Airways,@USAirways WTF is going on with the 1:30 from DC to BOS? Twice we go back back to the gate after leaving for the runway? Total BS.
11100,US Airways,@USAirways not moving we are in the tarmac delayed for some unknown reason. I'll keep you posted
11101,US Airways,@USAirways I keep missing my updated connections. Need to make it to #JAX to be in my friend's wedding! #strandedattheairport
11102,US Airways,@USAirways how are you guys losing luggage when it was suppose to be on the same flight I was on. Highly disappointed no meds no clothes :(
11103,US Airways,"@USAirways wanted to connect to discuss sponsorship opportunities with http://t.co/q6Xedzvhh9, silicon valleys only 10 day film festival"
11104,US Airways,"@USAirways @garywerk poor excuse. I was towards front of plane, no sandwiches, we have to pay for them, should have more"
11105,US Airways,"@USAirways I'm not patient. I'm annoyed. If you can't book this travel online, then you shouldn't make people wait on the phone."
11106,US Airways,@USAirways US airways csr at Phoenix airport fixed the problem
11107,US Airways,@USAirways still in yuma waiting for 2702 to go. Looks like I might miss 2696 to MontereyRegionalAirport need options please
11108,US Airways,"‚Äú@USAirways: @alan_bledsoe Thanks for your feedback, Alan.‚Äù Thx, but  no help as I watch a flt Lve w/open seats and I wait 3hrs for nxt flt"
11109,US Airways,@usairways I don't think the US site allows that (unlike http://t.co/etfjqIwUvt). Can I use a US credit if I held on http://t.co/etfjqIwUvt?
11110,US Airways,@USAirways lol me too
11111,US Airways,@USAirways still waiting on a response
11112,US Airways,@USAirways - who do I call to use credit fm. prev. cxl tix that can't be rebooked online?Rep I called quoted me $1k higher than the website.
11113,US Airways,@USAirways so basically I am stuck paying for hidden fees and being bumped to an inferior flight. JetBlue here I come. #usairways #mergers
11114,US Airways,@USAirways How will I change it?
11115,US Airways,@USAirways oh the irony. A dog who will not spot barking in waiting area is now right in front of me! Please send me a cocktail coupon stat
11116,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir when is US Air switching to AA iOS app? AA app is much better.
11117,US Airways,"@USAirways a $75 change is ok most of the time but if there r open seats on earlier flt and no chkd bag, why not let someone fly standby?"
11118,US Airways,"@USAirways thanks to the gate agent in State College, PA that was able to get me on an earlier flight AND figure out an earlier connection!"
11119,US Airways,@USAirways I just think it's weird to have mileage as 666
11120,US Airways,@USAirways flight 1783 CLT to BOS
11121,US Airways,@USAirways Some of my 4 kids are anxious. Husband and I can't sit with all 4 with current setup. No warning that our 6 seats changed.
11122,US Airways,@USAirways but you guys switched me and didn't inform me of the chathes
11123,US Airways,"@USAirways worst airline ever....left without luggage for 7 days, submit $700 expenses and they offer a refund of $297? #badservice"
11124,US Airways,"@USAirways your app is bad, and you should feel bad."
11125,US Airways,@USAirways Still irritated that our well planned and booked return was messed with &amp; with no warning.
11126,US Airways,@USAirways Is $99 companion ticket benefit of Premier World MasterCard still limited to USAirways flights or do AA now qualify as well?
11127,US Airways,@USAirways is probably losing a family of world travelers as customers due to broken processes. @AmericanAir I hope you can fix it
11128,US Airways,"@USAirways Only for one flight, though. The 2nd leg my kids are sitting scattered about the aircraft."
11129,US Airways,"@USAirways yes thanks I have never seen anything like this and I come to Yuma all the time, big disappointment. There are 40+ still waiting"
11130,US Airways,@USAirways You will be hearing a lot more from me instead of your feedback when I get back home.
11131,US Airways,@USAirways has the most ass backwards process for using credits on flights. even trying to get a hold of customer relations is impossible
11132,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir Will you be destroying lives in Eastern @GastonCounty during this lively little event? For profits you will.
11133,US Airways,@USAirways 5 hour cross country morning flight and you have no food? #BadService
11134,US Airways,"@USAirways @AmericanAir been with US Airways since 03,  back and forth Gatwick - Charlotte, then LHR. Bit sad nostalgic way."
11135,US Airways,@USAirways understood and I am sympathetic. How do I get my $100 back? I shouldn't have to pay especially if YOU switched my flight.
11136,US Airways,@USAirways we bought our tickets months ago. Had seats together for all 6. Haven't changed flight. Now 4 kids seats are scattered on plane.
11137,US Airways,@USAirways 1 person to check in 50 people and the plane boards in 20 minutes and he is telling people @AmericanAir exec bene's not honored
11138,US Airways,@USAirways no problem...just funny have a nice day

11140,US Airways,@USAirways Cancelled Flightled due to maintenance. The plane was there for 10 hours. Get your shit together because there are a lot of people unhappy.
11141,US Airways,@USAirways a year and every time with US Air something happens. I sat waiting for a re-scheduled flight for 10 hours then to say its
11142,US Airways,"@USAirways was switched to an American Airlines flight, not by choice, and now I am charged $50 for bags? Thought y'all merged?"
11143,US Airways,@USAirways My flight cost me just under $800 and this is what happens? I fly with @united and have no problems. I come the US 4-5 times...
11144,US Airways,@USAirways @OBJ_3 even airlines are scheming to get a follow from OBJ LMAOOO üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
11145,US Airways,@USAirways No I got to Philly on Monday and got to my final destination South Carolina on Wednesday. Its not acceptable.
11146,US Airways,@USAirways over an hour now and still no one at the Yuma counter
11147,US Airways,@USAirways can you DM me &amp; add me to the upgrade list for a flt tonight?
11148,US Airways,@USAirways now you have over 50 people in line. This is stupid!!! What the heck!
11149,US Airways,@USAirways some people in line have been waiting 55 minutes for a customer service representative
11150,US Airways,@USAirways @americanair I feel sorry for AA
11151,US Airways,@USAirways there has been NO one at the Yuma ticket counter for 30 minutes and there are about 30 people in line. Terrible service!!!

11157,US Airways,@USAirways thanks
11158,US Airways,"‚Äú@USAirways: Reminder: From 2/28, we‚Äôll be tweeting from @AmericanAir. You should join us: http://t.co/WBMHRl3bvl"
11159,US Airways,@USAirways thanks for telling me my flight was on time when the plane was broken. You're an inferior airline.
11160,US Airways,"@AlbertBreer just so you know who to complain to ;-) RT @USAirways: Reminder: From 2/28, we‚Äôll be tweeting from @AmericanAir."
11161,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir for frequent flyer miles can we schedule interchangeably and get credit?
11162,US Airways,@USAirways I've called to resolve my dividend miles issue for a week to no avail.  Please advise ASAP.
11163,US Airways,@USAirways they finally answered. They were rude and didn't help me at all.
11164,US Airways,"@USAirways @AmericanAir no, don't leave me!!!"
11165,US Airways,"@USAirways #success made flight , please thank the crew of 556 great time recovery"
11166,US Airways,"@USAirways I have 2d and 3d embossed badges and patches superior to the ones you are currently using. 
http://t.co/3fq3XElbOn"
11167,US Airways,@USAirways - so far so good this week. SAV to CLT boarded BEFORE the departure time (first time in 4 weeks). Perhaps an on time departure?!
11168,US Airways,@USAirways is this accurate? Safety guide shown no MP3 player usage during takeoff and landing. http://t.co/Nvk3IrG4KP
11169,US Airways,@USAirways I've been on hold for 36 mins and counting cause you charged my credit card for bag but provided no receipt and said error. Awful
11170,US Airways,"@USAirways  I have a party of 4 booked for a flight in Aug. At 10:05am, how can I find out how much it would cost to change to an earlier fl"
11171,US Airways,@USAirways 1917. Still sitting here. Feels badly handled.
11172,US Airways,@USAirways  Lilly M in SJU check in is fabulous!
11173,US Airways,@USAirways Was just on hold with you all for TWO HOURS and then got hung up on. oh my god.
11174,US Airways,@USAirways. On phone hold for 30+ mins trying to speak to an agent. Can't change reservation online. Sigh. #badcustomerexperience
11175,US Airways,@USAirways that's where we are now. Thank you.
11176,US Airways,"@USAirways I've been on a music hold for over a hour trying to get my AAdvantage membership merged, can someone please call me ASAP?"
11177,US Airways,@USAirways flight was full.  1 open middle seat.  Did not want to sit there.  What is your policy?
11178,US Airways,@USAirways 657. My daughter Candice and I are together with her baby.
11179,US Airways,"@USAirways sorry, I meant flight 4420, which was supposed to depart at 5:00, now says 6:30. What is the issue?"
11180,US Airways,@USAirways How about moving my seats to where I bought them 4 months ago? This happens far too often...
11181,US Airways,@usairways if you could change your name to @southwestair and do what they do...that'd be awesome. Also this plane smells like onion rings.
11182,US Airways,@USAirways #tbt every day.
11183,US Airways,@USAirways what's the issue with flight 4420 from jax being delayed tonight?
11184,US Airways,@USAirways got rebooked. Sent to A9. Wrong gate! Traveled back to B13 for correct flight. #tired&amp;frustrated
11185,US Airways,"@USAirways if you've got room on an earlier flight home, why charge me $75 to get on it? Be the hero!"
11186,US Airways,@USAirways @CakeNDeath Question is will he and his lady behave...
11187,US Airways,"@USAirways on the DL, send Ethan some new pants and some ""white revive"" laundry tabs. He's a great guy, good crew, he's just, err, single."
11188,US Airways,@USAirways any updates on flight 1917 from Philly to LA?  Been sitting at gate for close to 2 hours
11189,US Airways,@USAirways will these prices be honored? Ive waited this 1 1/2 hours on hold to make sure I can still get the prices I originally started
11190,US Airways,@USAirways thank you for refunding my bag fee.  I look forward to its return today I hope.
11191,US Airways,@USAirways what's happening with 1217 Phl to LAX? Now 3 hr delay. Poor communication!

11198,US Airways,@USAirways skys r sunny air is cold I can't wait to get to #CLT
11199,US Airways,@USAirways never imagined it would be so hard to SPEND money through US Air. Stubbornly hoping someone will come back to the phone.

11216,US Airways,@USAirways KUDOS to your phone support and Charlotte gate staff!

11227,US Airways,"@USAirways my wife is trying to check in for a flight tonight out of RSW...website not allowing, saying must go to airport... [Part 1 of 2]"

11236,US Airways,@USAirways i hate you
11237,US Airways,"@USAirways it is the same passenger, just her maiden name ended up as last name through online Flight Booking Problems.  Yes, understand non transferable"
11238,US Airways,@USAirways understood and so does us airways.  Getting through tsa is the problem
11239,US Airways,@USAirways I paid for my seat.  I expect to be able to use my full seat
11240,US Airways,"@USAirways if a passenger is to large to put down the armrest and now is using part of my seat, what is my recourse?  #nothappy"
11241,US Airways,@USAirways so I was just told I was coded as an upgrade... I clearly purchased this seat with my miles and refuse to downgrade. #ripoff
11242,US Airways,"@USAirways the gate agent said ""it's booked in full. Sorry"" I had a ticket with a 1st class seat. I will call customer service when I land."
11243,US Airways,"@USAirways Empty 1st class, Chairman can't move up due 2 silly award travel rule trumping common sense - customer service fail again!"
11244,US Airways,@USAirways can they change to correct last name? Did via reservations already but said can't change ticket name..
11245,US Airways,@USAirways you're the only airline that's not open sooner. It's not a confidence booster.
11246,US Airways,@USAirways checked in last night @ airport by supervisor w boarding pass for 1A - boarding today seat changed to 7F. How does that happen?
11247,US Airways,@USAirways new problem...had wrong last name on reservation which is airways fixed. New can't get through TSA
11248,US Airways,@USAirways cardholder is flying.  We both have us airways and advantage cards which is more frustrating.
11249,US Airways,@USAirways I received a brochure in the mail touting all the benefits of the advantage card with usa now merged...baggage included
11250,US Airways,"@USAirways if I paid for ticket with advantage world executive card, do I pay baggage fees when flying us airways? Wife traveling now"
11251,US Airways,@USAirways this has been the worst trip with little to no customer service
11252,US Airways,@USAirways testing my patience this evening (or shall I say morning?). We waited an hour at the gate for you to find a gate agent.  130am
11253,US Airways,"@USAirways flying from Manchester international to Philadelphia and getting emails about delays, no information about connecting flights.."
11254,US Airways,"@USAirways thank you.3860 to cincy.just landed.you should add frequent flyer miles to my account..  a long, incredibly frustrating day"
11255,US Airways,"@USAirways no. Other than being on my credit card statement, I have not received anything from you and so I have no way to look it up myself"
11256,US Airways,@USAirways I waited on hold for too long. I shouldn't have to wait on hold forever when I never received a confirm. in the 1st place #help
11257,US Airways,"@USAirways Been dealing w/ @americanair to solve the probs your team created. Your Manch, NH staff is clearly your C-team, btw. #NotEvenJV"

11259,US Airways,@USAirways Unfortunately I doubt that the consistently subpar service will improve with the @AmericanAir merger. #USAirways
11260,US Airways,@USAirways thank you. We filled out a claim and hope to have the bags tomorrow.
11261,US Airways,"@USAirways I didn't Cancelled Flight my flight, you did. Than you loved me to another flight and forgot my bags"

11265,US Airways,@USAirways just noticed that I don't believe I saw a confirmation for a flight I bought a few weeks ago. Def paid though. #help #resend?
11266,US Airways,@USAirways worst customer service. Still not providing me an answer even after I drove back to CLT airport. been rude &amp; unacceptable #fail
11267,US Airways,@USAirways any plans to support #ApplePay on board? I have the USAirways MC and it would be nice to still use it if I forget the card.
11268,US Airways,@USAirways got through on the phone. usair Cancelled Flightled her return flights because she missed a flight on her way out. they took care of it

11274,US Airways,@USAirways #flight4592 LET US OFF THIS PLANE!!!  please go to a gate.  This is absurd.
11275,US Airways,@USAirways will I get the full amount credited to my account for US Airways credit?
11276,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir 2 trips in a row with missing luggage. Just like last time. I pay for baggage to be transported.
11277,US Airways,@USAirways lost our luggage. #yay
11278,US Airways,@USAirways I found a flight I want on @CheapOair. Is my @AmericanAir AA Advantage # applicable to earn miles on it since you're merging?
11279,US Airways,@USAirways really frustrating to be endlessly waiting at PHL for a ground crew to taxi us in at 10pm at night. Why is this taking so long?!
11280,US Airways,@USAirways Thanks for calling me about my 10:00p redirected flight at 10:07p. #SmoothOperation
11281,US Airways,@USAirways : its just a very bad customer service experience// can you help
11282,US Airways,"@USAirways : i have been trying to reach dividend miles  to extend my ticket for last 3 days , 20 + calls and i get a message to call back"
11283,US Airways,@USAirways really!??
11284,US Airways,@USAirways how does an airline misplace an airline attendant?!! been at Reagan airport since 1pm10:15 to Cincy is delayed trying to find her
11285,US Airways,@USAirways My flight finally arrived in Charlotte.  They booked my luggage thru to lga but no room on flight for me.  What a mess
11286,US Airways,"@USAirways been on hold for over an hour, still don't know where my bags are, won't refund me my flight?!?! It wasn't weather!!"
11287,US Airways,@USAirways no your not!

11289,US Airways,@USAirways thank you for fixing my 5 hour delay.
11290,US Airways,@USAirways yup 1:34 minutes was my limit of waiting on hold so thanks for nothing
11291,US Airways,@USAirways this is more than having patience. This is not acceptable. http://t.co/N7pSuEJDC8
11292,US Airways,@USAirways please follow me so I can DM you about something
11293,US Airways,@usairways 4 flights in 48hrs &amp; I've had the same flight attendant for 3 of those flights. Freaky coincidence! Plus side she's great. :)
11294,US Airways,@USAirways landed safely everything worked out.
11295,US Airways,@USAirways can you explain why I am on hold over an hour .Other than I'm dumb and should be using a different airline #wth
11296,US Airways,@USAirways you used to have an evening flight DCA-DSM and an early AM return. Now it's middle of the work day for both. Inconvenient.
11297,US Airways,@USAirways delays to the max
11298,US Airways,@USAirways on Sunday! Can't wait! See you then
11299,US Airways,@USAirways well this is #nofun #nocustomerservice #onhold trying to make #reservations #nothappy http://t.co/m7MMq2f5FA
11300,US Airways,@USAirways it shouldn't take longer to get to the gate than the flight itself takes.... 59 minutes flying time - 47 minutes on runway so far
11301,US Airways,"@USAirways attempting ckin for flight on 2/19 all day, site unable to retrieve details.  Called twice and disconnected."
11302,US Airways,@USAirways Emailed them a week ago and still nothing...
11303,US Airways,@USAirways I would be willing to pay anything to change a flight! @AllegiantTravel does not! help!
11304,US Airways,@USAirways yeah you guys just told me to call the website that I booked from. I booked on your website. UNACCEPTABLE
11305,US Airways,@USAirways still waiting! Captain reports he's called 6 times to get ground crew....and still sitting on runway. #evenLate Flightr
11306,US Airways,@USAirways is the real MVP for holding up the flight connecting Philly to Tampa.
11307,US Airways,@USAirways finally rectified my flight situation! Thanks again
11308,US Airways,@USAirways so what is the  difference between Cancelled Flighting and reFlight Booking Problems - will that help me avoid a change fee?
11309,US Airways,@USAirways on time today and from PHL! Nice work! #ThereIsAFirstForEverything
11310,US Airways,@USAirways you have most likely lost my business. Terrible experience! Too many times stuck on Tarmac and last min Cancelled Flightled flights. #Done
11311,US Airways,@USAirways I have been doing that all day. Can't find my bag anywhere bc they're saying it was never scanned &amp; technically never left LAX.
11312,US Airways,@USAirways why no ground crew at DCA when we're already Late Flight arriving #evenLate Flightr
11313,US Airways,@USAirways being told 'tough break and this is how it is' is unacceptable. You can't even tell me when my bags will be here
11314,US Airways,@USAirways ice cream up front! Solid
11315,US Airways,@USAirways shout out to the pilots and FC attendant(Eliz) of US 673. Super strong crosswinds during landing. Eliz did a super job throughout
11316,US Airways,@USAirways now telling me I don't have the correct tag for my luggage!!! My luggage apparently is not in LA or Charlotte. This is not ok!!
11317,US Airways,"@USAirways Your software is broken. ""Call Customer Support"" is not the fix. Like I said earlier, yell at your developers."
11318,US Airways,@USAirways It's not double booked. I spoke with CS and we've got a plan to fix this. It's still an amateur mistake that should never happen.
11319,US Airways,"@USAirways is there nothing that can be done online to help? i bought these as a birthday present, just trying to be able to afford a change"
11320,US Airways,"@USAirways @AmericanAir hey guys, due to some horrible customer service issues is there any way I can get a checked bag credit?"
11321,US Airways,@USAirways delayed 2 days for weather and on top I got yelled at for being Late Flight when I was not notified of the time change #WellDone
11322,US Airways,@USAirways Not a great experience for my first time flying US Airways. Going forward I'll probably be taking my business elsewhere.
11323,US Airways,@USAirways ...Loosing a lot of business by using Barclays. I cant believe that you cant apply for a card if you live in Iowa.
11324,US Airways,@USAirways I was re accommodated for my DSM flight tonight after a delay from Myrtle Beach now the flight to DSM is back on for tonight?
11325,US Airways,@USAirways so far I've gotten six different answers
11326,US Airways,@USAirways Oh certainly. And now I have two $275 pending transactions on my bank account. Really happy that I was charged double.
11327,US Airways,@USAirways I got an email asking me to checkin TMRW for a flight I meant to book for 3/19 - can someone please help! @WallStSlumLord @PKG49

11342,US Airways,@USAirways I don't think I've ever had a us airways flight that went smoothly.
11343,US Airways,@USAirways PLEASE improve your phone system! Going through multiple prompts &amp; menus just to be told to call back Late Flightr = MAJOR FAIL
11344,US Airways,"@USAirways once again your service leaves a lot to be desired. Flight 5141 here early, but short staffing means we wait on Tarmac...Thanks"
11345,US Airways,@USAirways the Late Flightr flight to Charleston is leaving before the flight scheduled earlier.  That's so wrong
11346,US Airways,"@USAirways. I'm delayed in Cha, will miss my connection in Charlotte for lga.  Not good"
11347,US Airways,@USAirways we did. It added about seven hours to our day... So far... Want to take odds on our bags being on the carousel in KC? #notcool
11348,US Airways,"@USAirways @MarciaVeronicaa she missed her uncle's funeral, and you ""hope"" they can find another flight. That's very considerate of you."

11358,US Airways,"@USAirways after 3 Cancelled Flightlations and a delay, causing me to miss connecting flight. Another night not being home. Thanks #pathetic"
11359,US Airways,"@USAirways that's understandable, my issue is with creating a new flight without the personnel to do it...I changed my plans to accommodate"

11389,US Airways,@USAirways @DRVRugby  team is back home but luggage all wet and partly damaged - Not happy! #blizzard
11390,US Airways,@USAirways surprisingly quick response time by you and them. Thanks!
11391,US Airways,@USAirways stop Cancelled Flighting flights over and over and not provide any real help to your customers. #strandedinnashville
11392,US Airways,@USAirways strikes again...lost bags. And two of them. #theworst
11393,US Airways,@USAirways had 2 Cancelled Flight my trip to LA bc weather @SouthwestAir was easy but US air is making me pay $200 to use the credit. Never again
11394,US Airways,@USAirways What's the point of a baggage claim ticket if they don't scan it  for tracking?
11395,US Airways,@USAirways No access to Dividend Miles and for a week the automated phone keeps telling me to call back Late Flightr. #FRUSTRATED #LivePersonPlease
11396,US Airways,@USAirways you can't even track my bag to see where it is. It's like it's disappeared.
11397,US Airways,@USAirways Can't get ahold of anyone to speak to about missing miles. It's been over a month since travel &amp; I've submitted twice online
11398,US Airways,"@USAirways I been sitting on this plane for 40 minutes, and they are saying another 15 minutes something about paper work. This sucks !!"
11399,US Airways,@USAirways is there gonna be a better day to call? I've called on 3 separate occasions the past couple of weeks and never get to a person.
11400,US Airways,@USAirways I spent more on the room &amp; transportation then I did the whole flight
11401,US Airways,@USAirways I ask for reimbursement maybe miles added to my account for my inconvenience and for the money that I had to spend
11402,US Airways,@USAirways I asked for some reimbursement something like miles added to my account and was told to call customer service
11403,US Airways,@USAirways only to come home a day Late Flight to find out you guys have lost my luggage
11404,US Airways,"@USAirways Doubt it. Gate 35x is a cluster, and every agent encounter I saw (including one with me) was outright rude. Just very put off."
11405,US Airways,@USAirways I have to spend more than the cost of the flight just to get a free room and transportation to and from the airport
11406,US Airways,@USAirways the voucher you give us for a hotel is useless you call the number they say no rooms available what do you expect me to do?
11407,US Airways,"@USAirways so mad I can't even believe  you guys Cancelled Flight my connecting flight after I leave the first stop, &amp; give me a useless hotel voucher"
11408,US Airways,"@USAirways Priorities should have been made. Considering a pending snow storm, why delay a flight for an hour &amp; a half? I'd like an answer."
11409,US Airways,@USAirways: I experienced what defines customer service on #FLT1999. A flight attendant willing to follow up with a passenger on bag charges
11410,US Airways,@USAirways I've done everything. Still no luck in finding my bag. I don't understand how my bag could have been misplaced. Very upsetting.
11411,US Airways,@USAirways that wasn‚Äôt my Q but thanks. Wondering why you‚Äôre the only ones. I disguised yours to not call you out. ;) http://t.co/uH6UwuOSC0
11412,US Airways,@USAirways turns into @AmericanAir with such difficulty to past loyal customer. As a AA platinum flyer usair couldn't be more unhelpful. Why
11413,US Airways,Yes but I will nvr fly w/ @USAirways I missed my con flight bc of a coffeemaker on FT1892 Couldn't see my father be4 they put him in a coma
11414,US Airways,@USAirways 40 minutes to put my TSA number in‚Ä¶ 40 mins‚Ä¶ and stop holding people hostage with requiring a dividends miles acct. @tsa
11415,US Airways,@USAirways so I would have to go though the entire process again just to get you people on the phone???????? #usairwayssucks
11416,US Airways,"@USAirways really, so what does that mean??? #usairwayssucks"
11417,US Airways,@USAirways thanks!  Can you help remind the agents it's ok?  Ps. Heard rumors of a streaming wifi TV/movie service you might be installing
11418,US Airways,"@USAirways nope, done. Was supposed to get home at 9pm and didn't get home until midnight. #NeverAgain"
11419,US Airways,"@USAirways the only way to assist, is to actually answer the phone."
11420,US Airways,@USAirways would it kill you to give me 30-60 seconds of bad muzak instead of constant commercials while on hold?
11421,US Airways,@usairways would it kill you to let me put my tsaprecheck number on my reservation?
11422,US Airways,"@usairways would it kill you to not let 3,000 miles expire"
11423,US Airways,@usairways would it kill you to let me know how many minutes I might be on hold?
11424,US Airways,@USAirways a $100 @Samsonite - totaled. Not happy. Not at all.
11425,US Airways,@USAirways I have sent letter after letter and get back nothing but form letters and half baked reply's #usairwaysssuck
11426,US Airways,"@USAirways the least comforting thing from your pilot after sitting on a stationary plane for 3 hours is ""I don't really know what happened"""
11427,US Airways,.@USAirways thanks!
11428,US Airways,@USAirways my number is 214-725-1966.  CANT WAIT...LOL #usairsucks
11429,US Airways,@USAirways Have him call me.  I cant wait to see if anything happens.  Your service really sucks.#usairwayssucks
11430,US Airways,@USAirways she also appreciated having her very own hashtag! :) #lucycat
11431,US Airways,@scm1133 @USAirways we hate delays!! have you tried any of these?! http://t.co/7STktJXAN1 (although we're not sure what a timbit is...)
11432,US Airways,@USAirways Big fail on not having curbside baggage in Pittsburgh and you charge 30 dollars a bag!!
11433,US Airways,"@USAirways Is it possible to earn Dividend Miles for a passenger that is not me, even if I am purchasing the tickets?"
11434,US Airways,"@USAirways I hope so, too. Thank you for your help. She traveled halfway across the globe and just wants her suitcase."
11435,US Airways,@USAirways would you consider honoring the original fare price if I were to try Flight Booking Problems the ticket again?
11436,US Airways,"@USAirways booked an award ticket recently, now same ticket is less miles. how do I contact you without using the online form or phone?"

11438,US Airways,@USAirways would be more pleased if you reassess your business practices.  Goal should be to have passengers on plane as little as possible
11439,US Airways,"@USAirways that's ok, just know that I'll most likely never book with you again"
11440,US Airways,@USAirways I followed you complaint procedure only to get a run around.  Your service SUCKS #usairwayssuck
11441,US Airways,"@USAirways I don't mind waiting, I mind waiting on a plane, when I shouldn't have had to.  The airport has more room and you know.. food!"
11442,US Airways,"@usairways That is appreciated.  However, the system tells you call back Late Flightr then ends the call.  No need to reply, thanks."
11443,US Airways,@USAirways why would you board ppl on a plane b4 its their turn to de-ice? Why would you have ppl then wait through the hour long process?
11444,US Airways,@USAirways I tried that before using Twitter. Also gave me no helpful information. Thank you anyway
11445,US Airways,"@usairways I am sure you are sincere in your apology, its disappointing from a customer perspective when you want loyal customers #options"
11446,US Airways,@USAirways Yeah I know that...but now I'll have to spend almost 500 dollars more on my ticket since the price has gone up over the week
11447,US Airways,@USAirways yeah either by refunding my money or 2 free round trips to compensate for all the trouble we were put through.
11448,US Airways,"@USAirways 
Are you an incompetent airline every day, or just days that end in 'y'?"
11449,US Airways,@USAirways There isn't a ticket number...the transaction is still pending.
11450,US Airways,"@USAirways do families no longer get early boarding with young kids?  American, your new parent, gives it to us..."
11451,US Airways,@USAirways not patient - originally 11:51 and now 4:41.
11452,US Airways,@USAirways your agent did not say
11453,US Airways,"@USAirways no, they could be at Laguardia, JFK or Charlotte. I have no idea where they are now tho"
11454,US Airways,@USAirways they said because there was no meal on my flight they would not - what airline serves food anymore? Update in policy?
11455,US Airways,"@USAirways It is the 2nd person when I called again to ask, could not catch her name, rejected the request"
11456,US Airways,@USAirways must be nice to take your customer service phone off the hook! #fendforyourself
11457,US Airways,"@USAirways that link is broken. But if it's the online baggage locator, I already tried it and it gave me no useful information."
11458,US Airways,"@USAirways Spoke on the phone 3 or 4 times, but no resolution. I'm still waiting to get my money back but now prices are jacked up"
11459,US Airways,@USAirways thanks for reaching out to me.  My Gold Div no. 2k424j0. My Flights were changed under Confirmation # DNX58V.

11468,US Airways,Spend 1 HOUR on hold with @USAirways .
11469,US Airways,@USAirways why would a flight arrive Late Flight or leave when 60% of your passengers have  a connection?
11470,US Airways,@USAirways  last 2 times I checked a bags they were severally damaged.   No one answers the baggage call line for status?  #chairmanlove

11477,US Airways,@USAirways I've been trying to call you for days and every time the system is overloaded and disconnects. Really?  A global company?  Help!
11478,US Airways,"@USAirways Also, we are in family crisis &amp; you charge full price for all these flights, PLUS $200 2 change flights, even for emergencies."
11479,US Airways,@USAirways where's my apology?

11558,US Airways,@USAirways I gave up http://t.co/2eDgc6TbLs
11559,US Airways,@USAirways I've been on hold for one hour and four minutes for your reservations line. How can you possibly do business this way?
11560,US Airways,"@USAirways lack of communication with other offices, the customer, &amp; yall never update ur systems. U guys are 2 established 4 this mess"
11561,US Airways,@USAirways u guys get too much $$$ and too many customers  to be fucking up as badly as u do

11566,US Airways,@USAirways @Forsyth_Factor hope for no weather delays no help to reroute and your on your own for lodging non stop is the way to go
11567,US Airways,@USAirways why didn't you reroute BOS to JAX via DCA through CLT instead forcing an overnight @DCA #passengersLose
11568,US Airways,"@USAirways I appreciate the hard work. Still, I gave up after &gt;hour. @dsearls"
11569,US Airways,"@USAirways my luggage was delayed. I'm looking for compensation, since, you know, you charged me for it then forgot it..."

11575,US Airways,@USAirways not even on your dime and free tickets.  #worsttraveldayever
11576,US Airways,@USAirways disappointment? Making own arrangements for me &amp; my sleeping toddler with zero assistance from USAir is maddening.
11577,US Airways,@USAirways thank you
11578,US Airways,@USAirways thanks. We did see an agent. Unhelpful. Some got vouchers others did not for unexplained reasons.

11583,US Airways,@USAirways of course never again tho . Thanks for tweetin ur concern but not Doin anythin to fix what happened. I'll choose wiser next time
11584,US Airways,"@USAirways I absolutely knew you would try to blame weather to deny us vouchers in Phoenix. Totally false, was a crew issue."

11586,US Airways,@USAirways on the phone now. looks like global
11587,US Airways,"@USAirways Already filed a report personally at the airport, however they have no idea where it is even with a tracking number."
11588,US Airways,"@USAirways already called, no other options, flight is being reimbursed. Never again, you are unreliable for business travelers."
11589,US Airways,@USAirways your saving grace was our flight attendant Dallas who was amazing. wish he would transfer to Delta where I would see him again
11590,US Airways,"@USAirways that link leads to a website that won't open on a cell phone.  Good job, shocking that your airline is folding."
11591,US Airways,@USAirways My flight (US558) got Cancelled Flightled on 2/16 due to lack of flight crew.I was told that I'd be reimbursed for hotel. Who do I contact?
11592,US Airways,"@USAirways No need for apologies just an unfortunate situation . There is no up date, I've landed but was suppose to land at 5"
11593,US Airways,@USAirways ~45 minutes means no public transit home and an expensive cab. Promises doesn't make up for it
11594,US Airways,@USAirways my sister was supposed to leave at 10 am to go back to AL. She's only getting to NC now. Are you kidding me #NeverflyUSairways üëø

11599,US Airways,@USAirways Shout out to the red-headed gate agent for flt 3389 from DCA to CHS at 7:10 tonight. Didn't get her name but she was great!
11600,US Airways,@USAirways I'm sick of living in an airport!! #getittogether
11601,US Airways,"@USAirways Now, the JFK Baggage Office has actually run out of paper hotel vouchers. #thislinehasntmovedforanhour"

11616,US Airways,@USAirways not too impressed with your airlines but I would feel a lot better flying with if you upgraded me up to first class tomorrow

11634,US Airways,"@USAirways beware,  Barklays bank has terrible cust service. Will not assist, only know to go by badly written book(in English)."
11635,US Airways,@USAirways they call weather an act of God and refuse to help. I have my wife and 3 kids and they have no sympathy.
11636,US Airways,@USAirways bad weather shouldn't mean bad service

11650,US Airways,"@USAirways I did, but it won't help.. Can't believe you wouldn't take full fare for first class and gave away to Platinum Member.. Profits?"
11651,US Airways,@USAirways 1 1/2 hours on hold to customer service without anyone answering is more than ridiculous!
11652,US Airways,"@USAirways - I'm in the Cust Svc line.  Your Charlotte, NC agents better be in their A game."

11720,US Airways,"@USAirways I have now called 12 times in the last three days. That's unacceptable. I'm willing to wait on hold, but that's not an option."
11721,US Airways,@USAirways YOU ARE AMAZING!!! YOU ARE THE BEST!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE AND I FOLLOW YOU BACK;)üôèüôèüôè‚úåÔ∏èüòâ)
11722,US Airways,"@USAirways I've been on hold for over 2 hours. Need to re-book a flight, please help."
11723,US Airways,"@usairways It was 9¬∫, and some of us had left coats in our luggage in anticipation of cramped overhead bins :|"
11724,US Airways,@USAirways I'm traveling around the world until the end of the year. 800 numbers do me no good.
11725,US Airways,@USAirways I don't know I've tried to call for confirmation but calls aren't going thru. Can you let me know?
11726,US Airways,@USAirways can I get free wifi since the flight 1808 was Cancelled Flightled?
11727,US Airways,@USAirways was rebooked but sucked big time. Crappy layover. Customer service very sub-par.
11728,US Airways,@USAirways Sending thanks to employee Freddie in PHL Admiral Club A East for allowing me to give a day pass to my sibling stuck there today.
11729,US Airways,@USAirways have done that. Sadly no flight from CLT has gotten to IND today and we head back to Tampa tmrw.
11730,US Airways,@USAirways holding 30+ min and listening to your shitty ads on repeat for your credit make me hate your airline even more.  @delta is better
11731,US Airways,@USAirways I would be on my way but   wether has delayed yet again.. Love the Charlotte ice storm!!  Good luck with mad customers
11732,US Airways,@USAirways Please staff your flights approproately. Our entire flight is delayed because FA isnt here. I shouldnt have left Delta...
11733,US Airways,@USAirways tooooo many Cancelled Flightations! My chain of command hates me now
11734,US Airways,@USAirways  you Cancelled Flightled both my flights and refused to give a voucher despite no flights for 2days. @USAirways #neveragain
11735,US Airways,@USAirways I just think if I am staying w your airline &amp; rescheduling a flight I shouldn't absorb a fee that is the cost of 1/2 my flight
11736,US Airways,@USAirways that's why u guys are my #1 choice.
11737,US Airways,@USAirways thanks. üòí
11738,US Airways,@usairways I‚Äôm cool with weather delays etc. But lying and deceiving passengers to keep them from changing is reprehensible. #yousuck
11739,US Airways,"@usairways I just want to get home before Wednesday... Joke is over, 50hrs of Cancelled Flightlations and delays is enough!"
11740,US Airways,@USAirways how about a drink voucher for the next flight?? #winkwink
11741,US Airways,@USAirways nice touch with using my first name.  Very intimate.  I'll be filing a claim soon to be reimbursed. Have a us airways day!
11742,US Airways,"@USAirways The airline is embarrassing itself. I get that bad weather isn't your fault, but your response to it couldn't have been worse."
11743,US Airways,@USAirways any updates on flight 5202 from ORF to PHL no one at gate...  ;(
11744,US Airways,"@usairways Yes. Works in Firefox. 

Can do everything but finish purchase. Button turns gray, never submits. For a couple weeks now."
11745,US Airways,@USAirways 2.5 hours Late Flightr and the flight has been Cancelled Flightled. You gotta work on your internal communication skills.
11746,US Airways,"@USAirways had a horrible experience flying from Montego Bay to Philadelphia on 2/11. $125 2check a golf bag, constant selling in-flight"
11747,US Airways,"@usairways told no gates open at #ORD, needed to wait 20mins. Still waiting after about 4 mins."
11748,US Airways,@USAirways And it's 3:22 with no sign of boarding.... Can I please get another update?
11749,US Airways,@USAirways still can't get a real person on the phone to book a flight. Ready to just go with #jetblue since they care. #usairwayssucks
11750,US Airways,"@USAirways after missing my flight and reFlight Booking Problems 2x, I just walked onto another flight and my phone was still on the seat!!"
11751,US Airways,@USAirways great job communicating to the passengers! Flight 1855 doesn't exist anymore? http://t.co/hLZaHXkdSn
11752,US Airways,@USAirways thanks Travis at PHL A East checkin for knowing baggage policies. Skis &amp; boots count as 1. Teach your mgr who didn't know
11753,US Airways,@usairways Thx for responding :) When bags came there was mad rush towards end of jetway‚Äîwhy not just put thru baggage claim?
11754,US Airways,@USAirways @AmericanAir  we are on us/aa flight 4443.We  arrived at dca at 2:12. Waiting on our gate (33)for apx an hr now. No update?
11755,US Airways,@USAirways  Have an agent with reservations contact me instead of asking me to waste my time by sitting on the phone for hours
11756,US Airways,"@USAirways If you believe in keeping your customers happy, especially after a mistake was made on your part..."
11757,US Airways,"@USAirways Would love to combine AA and USAir accts. Unfortunately, one has my middle name &amp; one has middle initial. Won't allow change"
11758,US Airways,@USAirways I had a rep 10 min in who said she couldn't help so transferred me to dividend miles customer service
11759,US Airways,@USAirways right on. Up. Up &amp; away ‚úàÔ∏èüåû
11760,US Airways,@USAirways your customer service stinks. Trying to book a flight for hours now and keep getting hung up on. #usairwayssucks
11761,US Airways,@USAirways please please please let my plane back to the gate so I can get off as I will miss connection due to CLT closing. 2034
11762,US Airways,@USAirways we've (flight 4443) been sitting on the tarmac of dca for a while now waiting on a gate. Can we just use another gate?
11763,US Airways,@USAirways I hope flight 1855 is not being delayed because flight attendant didn't come to work! #nobackup
11764,US Airways,"@usairways you made us miss our flight, first class now I can't even enter the admirals club.  Not happy  dm me to fix this."
11765,US Airways,"@USAirways can you please DM me, my flight has been delayed going into CLT which will force me to miss my connection to LGA at 10:05pm"
11766,US Airways,@USAirways on hold for 2 hours. You know what just keep my money
11767,US Airways,@USAirways charging $200 2 change a flight is a rip off the reason I have 2 is out of my hands &amp; I want 2 reschedule same flight but in July
11768,US Airways,@USAirways flight 1808 is not leaving at 2:45 because we haven't even begun to board yet. Please update your website ASAP
11769,US Airways,@USAirways @Jack_Kairys (2/2) and another sent him to the wrong line...oh and the kiosks weren't working! #thanks
11770,US Airways,@USAirways also your employees were LESS then helpful when @Jack_Kairys was checking his bag. Two just left their desks completely (1/2)
11771,US Airways,@USAirways the phone number the gate gave me doesn't work either. What is your customer service phone number?
11772,US Airways,@USAirways done
11773,US Airways,@USAirways @Jack_Kairys your site clearly explains we are allowed a carry on. This was allowed at PIT but not BOS. How does that make sense?
11774,US Airways,"@USAirways never in my life have I dealt with such poor customer service, irresponsible staff and lack of care LGA-IAH day 2, baggage in NC?"
11775,US Airways,@USAirways Thks 4 tip. Seems like a workaround rather than a customer-friendly solution. They should have an easily accessible email.
11776,US Airways,@USAirways unfortunately not. I think I watched it take off from the bus. Rebooked for a Late Flightr flight now #planestrainsandautomobiles
11777,US Airways,@USAirways I was supposed to be on flight 1861 from Charlotte to RDU @ 8:20pm yesterday. Is the same flight scheduled for departure tonight?
11778,US Airways,@USAirways Thank you so much its been a very stressful day
11779,US Airways,"@USAirways me too. In the future, have a better harsh weather preparedness plan. So much of your staff called out that everything snowballed"
11780,US Airways,"@usairways If I could/wanted to call I wouldn't use the internet to make a reservation.

11786,US Airways,@USAirways you are horrendous.  Pull your shit together

11788,US Airways,"@USAirways I want my money back. Now we're sitting on the runway. After a 2 hour delay, waiting for the baggage to begin loading."
11789,US Airways,@USAirways how is your gate agent gonna tell me my flight is on time when its 5 minutes past departure time and the previous flights plane..
11790,US Airways,@USAirways this is the aforementioned pilot. @AmericanAir sure you want to merge with these patron hitting hoodlums? http://t.co/C24cEfa9pl
11791,US Airways,@USAirways  my flight was #3729...but I left my phone on the plane or the shuttle :(
11792,US Airways,@USAirways thank you! I tried that and they said they didn't have it. Anywhere else to try?

11794,US Airways,"@usairways and @AmericanAir  4 days of Cancelled Flightations, I have driven to 3 airports in 3 different states, spent more on gas than my flight."

11796,US Airways,@USAirways customer service at its finest
11797,US Airways,@USAirways No speciifc email. 1500 character limit for complaints. Is AA/US customer complaints adopting the twitter model?

11799,US Airways,@USAirways please hogs my next flight for me! I'm waiting on a bus to get me off one plane so I can run to the other. It leaves in two min!

11850,US Airways,@USAirways your customer service is horrible
11851,US Airways,@USAirways I expect something more than telling me to see an agent to rebook my flight...
11852,US Airways,@USAirways you have the ability to switch my flight to @AmericanAir but you cannot tell me where my bags are.
11853,US Airways,@USAirways I did and it's been a disaster. You had me sitting on the runway only to bring the plane back to the gate smh
11854,US Airways,@USAirways no we haven't because we've been in the same line at the service desk for an 1hr and 1/2 now in the same spot.
11855,US Airways,"@USAirways on your website and on your boards at Logan it said it was on time, so we went through security and got to the gate (2)"

11880,American,@AmericanAir why would I even consider continuing your point program when I received no perks or continued bad customer service? #senseless
11881,American,@AmericanAir we've already made other arrangements ourselves.
11882,American,@AmericanAir thanks for getting back to me. But I will find other airlines in the future.
11883,American,@AmericanAir why would I pay $200 to reactivate my points that are only useful for certain flights that aren't even worth $200?
11884,American,"@AmericanAir stranded for 24 hours in MIA, Patrick casimir has been the ONLY AA staff to apologize for the great inconvenience #unreal"

11984,American,"@AmericanAir said that AA does not provide in-flight wifi on the routes to China based on some federal laws, but United does, why is that?"
11985,American,"@AmericanAir Right. But more than two hours Late Flight, and it seems due to poor communication, which sounded like it was annoying on-plane staff"
11986,American,@AmericanAir I'm not sure what happened to my USAirways status when the merger took place.
11987,American,@AmericanAir can u help rebook passenger via Twitter/DM.  Been on hold for 1.5 hours. Thanks!
11988,American,"@AmericanAir I'd like to apologize to the gate agent for flight AA76, I was not aware that zone 1 was after the nine other precious gems."
11989,American,@AmericanAir my key point of confusion is whether I can make this change even though the initial Flight Booking Problems was on US Airways metal?
11990,American,@AmericanAir origin/destination/dates are the same. Going from US Airways connecting flight to AA direct flight. Award is saver level.
11991,American,@AmericanAir When will the old 777-200 fly ORD-PVG get upgraded?
11992,American,@AmericanAir I know. Just a little cold weather humor. :)
11993,American,@AmericanAir None of the #LAX flights into #DFW have been Cancelled Flightled. Those landing before and after ours are fine. Completely arbitrary.
11994,American,@AmericanAir that doesn't really answer my question. Maybe if I provide more details you can give me clarification...
11995,American,@AmericanAir this delayed bag was for my friend Lisa Pafe. She got her bag after 3 days in Costa Rica. Issue no updates on your system.

12009,American,"@AmericanAir You've misunderstood. @USAirways WOULD NOT do a same day flight change for me. The gate agent said, ""NO."""

12017,American,@AmericanAir I was happy to purchase the upgrade. If only it was avail on my next flight.

12020,American,@AmericanAir my flight to DFW from LIT on my way to PDX tomorrow was Cancelled Flighted. Can you help me?
12021,American,@AmericanAir The issue is the lack of consideration of an announcement made so Late Flight when the gate agent had been there for over an hour.
12022,American,@AmericanAir I understand. But why is this the only flight of the day not going out? Twice?! I'm now out of extra meds and diapers for baby.
12023,American,@americanair I sure do. I'm running version 3.10.0
12024,American,@AmericanAir you could train your flight attendants to have some manners and decency

12042,American,@AmericanAir we've already made other arrangements ourselves.
12043,American,@AmericanAir thanks for getting back to me. But I will find other airlines in the future.
12044,American,@AmericanAir why would I pay $200 to reactivate my points that are only useful for certain flights that aren't even worth $200?
12045,American,"@AmericanAir stranded for 24 hours in MIA, Patrick casimir has been the ONLY AA staff to apologize for the great inconvenience #unreal"

12147,American,@AmericanAir I'm not sure what happened to my USAirways status when the merger took place.
12148,American,@AmericanAir can u help rebook passenger via Twitter/DM.  Been on hold for 1.5 hours. Thanks!
12149,American,"@AmericanAir I'd like to apologize to the gate agent for flight AA76, I was not aware that zone 1 was after the nine other precious gems."
12150,American,@AmericanAir my key point of confusion is whether I can make this change even though the initial Flight Booking Problems was on US Airways metal?
12151,American,@AmericanAir origin/destination/dates are the same. Going from US Airways connecting flight to AA direct flight. Award is saver level.
12152,American,@AmericanAir When will the old 777-200 fly ORD-PVG get upgraded?
12153,American,@AmericanAir I know. Just a little cold weather humor. :)
12154,American,@AmericanAir None of the #LAX flights into #DFW have been Cancelled Flightled. Those landing before and after ours are fine. Completely arbitrary.
12155,American,@AmericanAir that doesn't really answer my question. Maybe if I provide more details you can give me clarification...
12156,American,@AmericanAir this delayed bag was for my friend Lisa Pafe. She got her bag after 3 days in Costa Rica. Issue no updates on your system.
12157,American,@AmericanAir thanks!
12158,American,@AmericanAir Aww Thanks AA..DFW was on GMA up here this AM..so i understand ..Btw A.A is my Airline when im able to trv..Love you guys.:)

12169,American,@AmericanAir another day another grievance with this airline. No customer service
12170,American,"@AmericanAir You've misunderstood. @USAirways WOULD NOT do a same day flight change for me. The gate agent said, ""NO."""

12181,American,@AmericanAir my flight to DFW from LIT on my way to PDX tomorrow was Cancelled Flighted. Can you help me?
12182,American,@AmericanAir The issue is the lack of consideration of an announcement made so Late Flight when the gate agent had been there for over an hour.
12183,American,@AmericanAir I understand. But why is this the only flight of the day not going out? Twice?! I'm now out of extra meds and diapers for baby.
12184,American,@americanair I sure do. I'm running version 3.10.0
12185,American,@AmericanAir you could train your flight attendants to have some manners and decency
12186,American,@AmericanAir change fee = same price of new ticket... Not logical
12187,American,@AmericanAir Nice to read it! Thank you very much!
12188,American,@AmericanAir we have been advised to turn this issue over to the police due to the sexual assult THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING THAT ON YOUR PLANE!

12265,American,"@AmericanAir Lots of upset people, freezing terminal, and no gate agent. Kept us waiting on plane beyond allowable time length."
12266,American,@AmericanAir The pilot admitted to us that this delay is entirely because of AA incompetence and poor equip checks.

12272,American,@AmericanAir and then wanted to change it to BA for Avios.
12273,American,@AmericanAir Oh that seems to have undone the seat selections in MCE. We only wanted the CX card on there to select the free seats
12274,American,"@AmericanAir To announce DURING BOARDING that you chose to limit catering to the point that you WILL run out shows a lack of planning, IMO."

12369,American,"Thank you, @AmericanAir! Much appreciated."
12370,American,"I'd like the 11c I originally tried for @AmericanAir - again, happy to pay the difference"
12371,American,@AmericanAir when will you be issuing a weather advisory for RDU?? the entire state of NC has shut down from the overnight winter storm.
12372,American,@AmericanAir I‚Äôm still waiting - this has been going on far too long. Is there someone I can speak to?
12373,American,"@AmericanAir mission accomplished today, Thank you!"
12374,American,@AmericanAir  zoom in on the sauce and potatoes.  This stuff is vile.  And I mean vile. http://t.co/m2PHoavRxC
12375,American,@AmericanAir when will the merging of miles between you and @USAirways be complete? Wasn't it this month?
12376,American,@AmericanAir - 6 months ago best catering out of all domestic airlines. Today. Worst on the planet. And I've flown almost all of them
12377,American,"@AmericanAir when will there be wifi on the DCA-STL route?  2 hour flight, could use some love!"
12378,American,@AmericanAir   What is that!? Why even bother catering dog food that no one will eat ? http://t.co/iFESPcBzTm
12379,American,@AmericanAir  thanks for making the worst fly experience ever. Will never book again with your airline. Train your flight attendants better.
12380,American,@AmericanAir I lost my (basket) ballbag on your plane
12381,American,@AmericanAir thanks for the great customer service. Family made it back to SAT safely. The weather at DFW made things a little worrisome.
12382,American,@AmericanAir She seems a little preoccupied - that's why I'm bringing it to your attention. I am just flagging an issue as an observer.
12383,American,"@AmericanAir She was at gate on time though, they made her cry, and made a scene for 10 mins instead of boarding her. Plane still outside."
12384,American,"@AmericanAir Disappointing lack of kindness toward this person. The agent asked her counterparts ""why this person was talking to her""."

12387,American,@AmericanAir fantastic thanks! Will try and tweet a photo of the view :)
12388,American,@AmericanAir excellent!  Love you guys!  If it is first class I'll hug ya'll!  See you shortly!
12389,American,"@AmericanAir Thanks, have emailed them. How long should I expect for a response?"

12394,American,@americanair One question.. my wife didn't get the bonus. Should I call about it today?
12395,American,"@AmericanAir but not sufficiently sorry to actually *do* anything about it, I guess. Your systems are presumably beyond reproach or reform."
12396,American,@AmericanAir Good morning!  Wondering why my pre-TSA check was not on my boarding pass this morning??
12397,American,@AmericanAir  Yes I do bit you don't follow me so I can't DM you
12398,American,@AmericanAir as your flight attendants are an extension of your brand - bitchy flight attendants on 5:30 am flights are not appreciated.

12422,American,@AmericanAir Horrible service @loganairports. Luggage got destroyed on flight and woman at baggage service was so rude. Didn't help at all.
12423,American,@AmericanAir That‚Äôs a rather clunky process. Whoever designed that clearly doesn‚Äôt understand e-mail 101.

12582,American,"@AmericanAir couldn't get anyone on the phone all day, the flight you rebooked had me missing a conference.We won't be on flt 1568 tomorrow."

12585,American,@AmericanAir btw you guys should consider making a lounge at Austin Intl. airport! Very popuLate Flightd area! Will help the company for sureüëå
12586,American,"@djevolutionhd As an EP who travels 125K+ miles a yr with @AmericanAir , I would expect more from them than this horrible travel experience"
12587,American,@AmericanAir Are you expecting any delays out of #DFW tomorrow morning?
12588,American,@AmericanAir that was the worst customer service experience ever. Too bad for you I'm a lawyer. Enjoy my wrath.
12589,American,@AmericanAir it's beyond complicated now and it feels like when I used to fly with United. Platinum means nothing.
12590,American,@AmericanAir I look forward to hearing back and hope that my next trip will not be like this
12591,American,@AmericanAir Oh trust me. I am in love. It is so beautiful!
12592,American,@AmericanAir followed!  Sure hope you can help!

12601,American,@AmericanAir There are only 24 hours to Cancelled Flight or change itineraries booked online and that 24 hours is just about over. Impossible scenario
12602,American,@AmericanAir there are no more flights via united when I arrive to DFW and my car is parked at IAH üòÅ
12603,American,"@AmericanAir your online site doesn't have flights listed in chronological order, resulting in a mis-purchase. Anything that can be done?"
12604,American,@AmericanAir I FOUND MY FOOTAGE!! :D I am so so happy.
12605,American,@AmericanAir well we cleared customs in AUH. I need to get to IAH after I arrive in DFW. Is it possible to retrieve my luggage in IAD?

12615,American,"@AmericanAir $600 Late Flightr, 2 complete itinerary changes, and lost work and time, but yeah ""I"" got it rebooked"
12616,American,@americanair Not surprised that you were the Fastest Responding US Brand on Twitter for Q2 + Q3 2014. Also 10th fastest in the world in Q3
12617,American,@AmericanAir you've got to be kidding. Look at the pictures.  I'm hoping it's on the flight that just came in. The whole story is 2 much
12618,American,"@AmericanAir You're clueless. A kind rez agnt contacted USAir 4me around midnite, told them what to do. If not that I'd have missed funeral."
12619,American,"Nice try @AmericanAir I heard your crew whisper ""she's still at the hotel, she probably doesn't think she has to work until tomorrow"""
12620,American,@AmericanAir do you have hand sanitizer in the bathrooms on your flights?
12621,American,@AmericanAir I'm at the airport right now and your people didn't know how to react and help me with this situation. Very frustrated.

12625,American,@AmericanAir my mom tried also. That wasn't the reason they wouldn't change it. Y'all literally said that you'd rather have an empty seat.

12652,American,@AmericanAir absolutely disappointed in your lack of service. Lost my bag and can't even deliver it after I was told it would happen.
12653,American,@AmericanAir Just followed you.
12654,American,@AmericanAir What are Preferred Seats?

12659,American,@AmericanAir Can I use an SWU on an Finnair codeshare of an American operated flight (JFK-MAN)?  Thanks in advance for the help!
12660,American,@AmericanAir We tried with multiple people. I already sat on the phone for an hour and a half and got nowhere.
12661,American,@AmericanAir which one.?i have been booked on 6 different ones in the past 2 days
12662,American,"@AmericanAir Nope. Couldn't make changes online and after 90 mins on hold and time dealing w/ the rude rep, the 24 hour window has closed."
12663,American,"@AmericanAir doesn't care about customers, break your gear and tell u they can't do anything. @WSJ @latimes @chicagotribune #media #filmcrew"
12664,American,@AmericanAir yes....twice...for two different flights and occasions
12665,American,@AmericanAir Why is your cover photo of TWA? Just wondering.
12666,American,@AmericanAir unable to access the website.  Will try again.
12667,American,@AmericanAir yikes.
12668,American,.@AmericanAir Hopefully it's all fixed. They've got a new aircraft for us- just waiting to board.

12671,American,@AmericanAir I loved todays fight. But there was a bad draft on the airplane please add more air to air thanksm
12672,American,Keep it up :) @AmericanAir
12673,American,@AmericanAir @louprice13 @aacustomerservice. Apology not good enough. 4 planes with mechanical and 9 hours delayed unacceptable.
12674,American,@AmericanAir thx for the apology.   A commitment to fix your broken system would be better.  Actually fixing it would be better still.
12675,American,@AmericanAir seats that were assigned are inappropriate for child this age. AA knew age of child.
12676,American,@AmericanAir this is the biggest joke I've ever seen and will be telling everyone never to use you guys cause you are a joke
12677,American,@AmericanAir Pay for my accommodations when you are the ones Cancelled Flightling it for no reason and I know your saying (lying) it cause of weather
12678,American,@AmericanAir airport and 2 extra nights for hotels and not once have I heard of anything from your embarrassing airline saying that you will
12679,American,@AmericanAir This is getting a bit ridiculous when and you have made me miss 2 full days off work and had to pay for cabs back and forth
12680,American,@AmericanAir your assistance has not been very helpful frustrating disappointing experience &amp; w/small children very inconvenient
12681,American,@AmericanAir Cancelled Flight my flight saying it is cause of weather condition when it was the only flight that was Cancelled Flight
12682,American,@AmericanAir Again you guys are a huge joke and Cancelled Flight your flight for no reason. This is the 3rd time in one trip for me that you have
12683,American,@AmericanAir WHAT IS GOING ON?  This is pathetic. Online doesn't work and phone wants $25 to give a seat assignment.
12684,American,@AmericanAir I've just received the ticket. Thank you for your help

12686,American,@AmericanAir This is getting out of hand. I called Reservations to reserve the seats that it won't let me select online and there's a fee...
12687,American,"@AmericanAir on flight 1074 that has been delayed for hours over human errors like a food truck hitting the plane, now the lines are frozen."
12688,American,@AmericanAir so disappointed with this airline never again will I book with you guys
12689,American,@AmericanAir thanks
12690,American,"@AmericanAir You found my lost luggage, won't bring it to me until tomorrow. Next day if the weather isn't nicer. Terrible service"
12691,American,@AmericanAir Would it be ok to send you a DM asking a few questions because i'm deaf and been on hold so long?
12692,American,"@AmericanAir ""sorry you were disappointed"" #outoftouchwithreality #people have kids and jobs"
12693,American,@AmericanAir @nrosenb1 It's not allowing me to book available seats
12694,American,"@AmericanAir seriously, all flights from Detroit to Dallas are Cancelled Flightled 2 days in a row. I want to get home &amp; see my wife &amp; kids."
12695,American,@AmericanAir of delays and trapped on planes with no water or air. Never ever ever again. #neveragain #aafail
12696,American,@AmericanAir LITERALLY just told me they'd rather have an empty seat than my mom get to come earlier &amp; take me to Dr. appointment. WOW
12697,American,@AmericanAir we have posted your response on facebook for everyone to see people are appalled by your lack of concern
12698,American,@AmericanAir I had an advantage # and you deactivated it. I don't think you should deactivate a customers acct without their knowledge #help
12699,American,@AmericanAir thanks for making this the worst flying experience ever. 4 different planes of mechanical issues and 12 hours and counting
12700,American,"@AmericanAir If it's in my backpack, why do I need to see agent?"
12701,American,@AmericanAir I really wanted to sign up for your airline credit card but your absurd $400 change fee to switch my flight made me think twice
12702,American,@AmericanAir she sent you an email 2 customer service the night it happened ur response was basically 2 bad sorry how should she contact u.
12703,American,@AmericanAir Hi AA ! I placed an itin on hold to expire on 2/27.Just logged into my acct..its gone! Seat hasn't been released to inv. Help?
12704,American,"@AmericanAir  TPA - ORD!!! AA1679 Another successful journey, thanks for the hospitality!"
12705,American,@AmericanAir Thank you for the response. Much appreciated!
12706,American,@AmericanAir 4369. about 4 flights all using same gate w/buses to the planes.  Awful boarding process. Hour and a half Late Flight
12707,American,@AmericanAir is there another line I can call when I am on hold for 5 hours? Also how can I get compensated for this loss of time and money?
12708,American,"@AmericanAir @Rizzilient After days, I finally got the automated service to call me back but it hung on me! This is beyond ridicules.  help!"
12709,American,@AmericanAir Asked for a waiver of a change fee for flight booked w/in past 24 hrs. Rep was rude. Just told me no. Didn't even try to help!
12710,American,@AmericanAir any idea why flight 5392 from HSV to DFW tomorrow Cancelled Flightled about 45 minutes ago?
12711,American,"@AmericanAir thanks.  I actually made it, my connection flight was delayed.  Guess all delays are not a bad thing. http://t.co/XGgCNTco8m"
12712,American,@AmericanAir the issue wasn't a long wait. It was an infinite do loop. Your system didn't let me (or any customer) wait or leave a message.
12713,American,@AmericanAir Did the policy change? I've seen people with hamsters and rabbits before.
12714,American,@AmericanAir thanks to your attendant on flight for advising connect flight held.  Ran with kids and flight departed. Poor service at Miami
12715,American,@AmericanAir an hour now waiting on the phone for US Air help. 10 hours waiting at the airport yesterday. Love the service guys.
12716,American,@AmericanAir I'm here standing at baggage claim waiting for bags FOR OVER AN HOUR at DFW. The gate is 100 feet from here! #nothappy
12717,American,@AmericanAir right so I missed my connection / had a three hour Kay over / then you lost my bag.
12718,American,"@AmericanAir obviously we did see an agent-booked us for tomorrow morning. No hotel, no transportation. #pregnantwithtwins #stranded #angry"
12719,American,@AmericanAir I was suppose to be in FL 4 hours ago. And I'm not. I've been waiting for hours this is just ridiculous
12720,American,@AmericanAir my 2498 to CLT left the gate. What is next for CLT. Need help
12721,American,@AmericanAir you have a company policy that refuses employees to speak to other employees over the phone? Interesting
12722,American,@AmericanAir still on hold. After you hung up on me the first time (another 45 minutes!) http://t.co/IMRLAu77iH
12723,American,@AmericanAir if it I have not rebooked didn't get notified that it was Cancelled Flightled
12724,American,@AmericanAir is that the flight for tomorrow?

12727,American,"Still thinking, those PJs may have me sold @AmericanAir @momsgoodeats We'd #love to have you on board with us! @MandarinJourney here I come"
12728,American,@AmericanAir Do you have any flights with lie flat seating from STL to PDX around the date of March 5?
12729,American,@AmericanAir how do you refuse a customer who is willing to pay to upgrade when half of your first class is empty
12730,American,@AmericanAir customer service (if you can call it that) refunded my money
12731,American,@AmericanAir im still on hold...
12732,American,@AmericanAir you ever wonder why you find yourselves responding to so many customer complaints on twitter? It's because your airline sucks.
12733,American,@AmericanAir Are you people cruel or just stupid? Why are you posting my personal email on the damn Internet? Have u lost your mind?!
12734,American,@AmericanAir Do we get a class discount on your wifi? I will be flying your airlines at approx. 4 Am?
12735,American,@AmericanAir #customerservice. Sitting on my fourth plane today with a mechanical problem. No excuses for this. Tough to be loyal.

12739,American,@AmericanAir needs an entire customer service overhaul @Delta would never treat its customers with anything less that A1 service
12740,American,@AmericanAir are you guys intentionally trying to lose customers and money?
12741,American,"@AmericanAir why do you continually play the ""according to federal regulations"" every 58 seconds. I could see if you had quicker service..."
12742,American,@AmericanAir can I send you my trusted traveler ID to add to my reservation for tsa pre?
12743,American,"@AmericanAir thanks, but I had to hire a car in Chicago and drive to MKE. Does that mean I have to go to the airport?????"
12744,American,@AmericanAir the folks at the Executive Platinum desk are great pros.  They understand my displeasure with change fees and switch to SW.
12745,American,@AmericanAir He thanks you. Anything you can do to help. Would any further information help in the process?
12746,American,@AmericanAir thanks for a Cancelled Flightled flight then a delayed flight and NOT telling us More missed work More $ on hotel #WorstCustomerService
12747,American,@AmericanAir Flight 3487 delayed 1 hour because of pilots? I spend 5+ hours on the phone just to get an EP agent on the phone now this?
12748,American,.@AmericanAir Advised GAs and pilot of my flight. Too bad no one took action.
12749,American,@AmericanAir @USAirways need to be reported to the @BBB_media for their complete disregard for paying customers! #DoNotFlyWithThem
12750,American,@AmericanAir anything in particular I should ask for.   Will they want me to document my mileage plus status!
12751,American,@AmericanAir how about you give us a number to call instead of the empty email since you are not working on it
12752,American,"@AmericanAir I have been checking consistently, and called multiple times. As a loyal AA customer, I'm disappointed."
12753,American,@AmericanAir congrats on your call center customer service! A guy named Fidencio answered and he went above &amp; beyond to help me! üëåüëåüëå

12758,American,@AmericanAir it's not about the delay.  It's about the communication.
12759,American,"@AmericanAir would you like any additional details of my issue? Airport, flight, agent name? Or are you happy w/ this automated lip service?"
12760,American,@AmericanAir 3611 was supposed to depart at 5:10pm central.  About ready to close the door at 7:34pm central.

12801,American,@AmericanAir Lady at B1 ABQ for 5347 on 2/23 was of a great service to all among several Cancelled Flightlations
12802,American,@AmericanAir any ways to get through the 50 minute wait to book a flight?
12803,American,@AmericanAir Can you provide guidance on how I should work with them to resolve the issue
12804,American,"@AmericanAir Really?They closed the gate at 10:30 instead of40.I got there at 10:39. If u wudda put in my ktn like I asked, I wudda made it."
12805,American,"@AmericanAir trying to change flight via DFW tomorrow, can't get thru on phone, long wait then cut off x2, can you help please?"
12806,American,@AmericanAir thanks for following up- it finally worked!! Fingers crossed the new flight works.
12807,American,@AmericanAir stuck on the tarmac in CLT because the our gate is not open. Hope I don't miss my connection.... #logistics #AmericanView

12817,American,@AmericanAir What are we going to do about the nightmare you guys out me through yesterday? Zero response from the tweet you last sent me.
12818,American,@AmericanAir I tried site &amp; doesnt allow me. Same reason why I wasn't allowed to board this morning. Will try diff airline for work trips
12819,American,@AmericanAir I bought a plane ticket 2 months ago and still haven't received my flight info and ticket in my email when it will come?
12820,American,"@AmericanAir your DCA baggage claim employees should realize a please, a thank you and an apology can go a long way #customerservice #DCA"
12821,American,@AmericanAir  2/2 You took cost for both flights out of my bank account. Now I can't get a refund for 2 weeks? I have been a loyal customer.
12822,American,@AmericanAir I took the day off from work and drove 9 hours round trip to rescue my daughter and 3 other students from LaGuardia. Thanks!
12823,American,@AmericanAir you're airline is ridiculous
12824,American,@AmericanAir the group of minor children were broken up into groups. Some still in Miami. Delta has much better customer service!
12825,American,@AmericanAir Is there a way I can get a record of all the flights I've taken with you?
12826,American,"@AmericanAir Thank you for the response, we got it resolved at the counter."
12827,American,"@AmericanAir that's the one. My original arrival time was 10:14am, after all said and done I may be there by 9:19pm central. Not impressed."
12828,American,@AmericanAir My flight 1389 from Las Vegas to DFW was Cancelled Flightled! I've been on hold forever and I still have not spoken to anyone! Pls Help
12829,American,"@AmericanAir every time I try to call, it tells me to try again Late Flightr and just hangs up."
12830,American,@AmericanAir rebooked into a different airport. Throwing a wrench into plans üëÄ
12831,American,@AmericanAir crew did the best they could but it was out of their control. You only get one chance of a honeymoon &amp; you failed miserably
12832,American,"@AmericanAir Thx, someone picked up after 45 minutes"
12833,American,@AmericanAir overbooked business class from Mia to uvf - after being in the correct seat we were moved back to economy on our special day
12834,American,@AmericanAir no kidding! Gonna take some beating on the apron... And there are some good lookin' planes out there!
12835,American,@AmericanAir that's unacceptable
12836,American,@AmericanAir so what if I didn't have the funds to purchase another ticket? Your error would cause my family to miss the funeral
12837,American,@AmericanAir I have to miss a whole days worth of work tomorrow but I'm suree you guys don't care
12838,American,@AmericanAir this is a big company should be happy to do something for a customer when now it's costing more for delays oh and did I mention

12844,American,@AmericanAir my bags were checked through to Cancelled Flightled flight 362. When will they arrive in MKE? Not much help from grnd staff. Havoc in DFW
12845,American,"@AmericanAir I'd just like to know where my bag is, when I'll get it and why I don't have it already. No accountability from Cust Service."
12846,American,@AmericanAir I will never fly with you guys again! I am stuck in memphis another day. Called to be credit something anything
12847,American,@AmericanAir - don't be jealous.  I live in Sydney and my T-shirt and jeans don't suit the office for work. I need suits and a warm jacket.
12848,American,@AmericanAir @Rizzilient I booked tickets using miles and need to change the dates.  Have been trying to get to an advantage rep 4 two days
12849,American,@AmericanAir is the company from hell with NO consideration for customers that give it hundreds of millions of dollars per year #SMH
12850,American,@AmericanAir No snow in St. Louis. Cold but no snow. Hub flights welcome.
12851,American,@AmericanAir Took a flight yesterday fron TPA-DFW-AUS. Bag went to IAH. Today bag went to IAH-DFW and then back to IAH. Still no bag!
12852,American,@AmericanAir it is absolutely unacceptable.  I have been calling all day and am hung up on every time. I just need a 5 minute bit of help!
12853,American,"@AmericanAir - Envoy Airlines is a disgrace to the AA family.  Nothing but delays and Cancelled Flightlations, week after week."
12854,American,"@AmericanAir It's not about weather, it's logistics. Why should I hold for 90 minutes when you called me? Why not get more desk agents?"
12855,American,@AmericanAir We've sent you more info via DM.  I truly hope you resolve this very quickly. #media #filmcrew #cnn #nbc
12856,American,@AmericanAir I've never had anything bad to say until now. No love for faithful customers.

12862,American,"@AmericanAir I had it until last night, but because ""severe weather"" I could make the needed changes and now fair goes up 150 each."
12863,American,@AmericanAir Thanks to AA for the upgrade today and getting me on a new flight after my first one was Cancelled Flightled!
12864,American,"@AmericanAir has the worst flight change policy. No mercy, no sympathy, such a bummer when you can't go to funerals or see friends bc of it."
12865,American,@AmericanAir what's done is done. Not much you can do at this point. Trip is already over.
12866,American,@AmericanAir basically u right now http://t.co/IN24Bpb7dw

12878,American,"@AmericanAir not only on both legs did I have damaged seat, u damaged an expensive case and not offered anything.Just an apology 6wks Late Flightr!"
12879,American,@AmericanAir @USAirways I've tried to be understanding and let you handle the situation but I guess I was wrong about that
12880,American,@AmericanAir @USAirways over an hour on the phone the best you can tell me is it was sent maybe my bank misplaced it...
12881,American,"@AmericanAir My chariot tonight. From this angle it looks like a 787, no? http://t.co/3ZZKQWWbJz"
12882,American,@AmericanAir @USAirways day has come where I was suppose to get my money back from you but my bank hasn't received anything but after

12885,American,@AmericanAir probs the worst customer service ever. Replied to complaint I submitted 6 weeks ago bout damaged bag... Not even replacing it!
12886,American,@AmericanAir I Cancelled Flightled my ticket and is taking two months ++ to refund and still waiting!

12894,American,@AmericanAir You guys are the talk of the Americans down here in Ecuador! Read this! https://t.co/5ON3KlzVMT
12895,American,@AmericanAir should prob give me a refund since they made me miss my flight waiting to talk to someone for 3 hours... http://t.co/4SFpcbyy9m
12896,American,@AmericanAir I've tried...its @USAirways anyway
12897,American,"@AmericanAir oh I did. All I received back was an email saying "" delays happen"".. Uh huh.."
12898,American,@AmericanAir How do I place it on hold and complete payment? I don't see any way to do that from my reservations page.
12899,American,@AmericanAir Bad weather happens. But not being able to get through to a reservations rep for over 6 hours is just crazy. #frustrated
12900,American,@AmericanAir Flight Get Me Out Of Chicago.
12901,American,@AmericanAir why are customer svc reps unable to handle calls. Is there a 24hrs Cancelled Flightlation policy? Booked yesterday need to Cancelled Flight
12902,American,@AmericanAir Bad weather is understandable but your own pilot said that over 160 people called out and that ZERO bags are on the plane.
12903,American,"@AmericanAir yep,filed a claim at Heathrow yesterday. We were promised a call this morning with an update, but got nothing."
12904,American,@AmericanAir why is does it seem to be impossible to contact anyone at your airline to get an item left on board a plane 5 min after deplane
12905,American,@AmericanAir you flew me into Chi instead and I got a ride to MKE. U said my bags would go to MKE today. Is it on the Cancelled Flightled flight tho?
12906,American,@AmericanAir stuck at gate Miami to JFK flight 1510. Are we going to get out of here tonight? Very frustrating
12907,American,@AmericanAir I understand they're busy &amp; doing their best. My frustration is an automated call changing my flight w/o allowing me to talk
12908,American,@AmericanAir HELP U said ud chnge our retrn flght since we missed our connection Sat &amp; now ur not pickng up the phone.Only hve 18 hrs left!
12909,American,@AmericanAir has been almost a month and still no response to my online complaint/questions. Out $300 because of it.
12910,American,@AmericanAir bad weather happens but lack of preparation is inexcusable. Depending on good weather is not a good business model.
12911,American,@AmericanAir how is US4623 going to be on time when they are still deplaning at 4:08? This is BS.
12912,American,"@AmericanAir so, what should he do next exactly?!"
12913,American,@AmericanAir Flight for tomorrow was Cancelled Flightled. New one booked. Seats taken care of. Just a tweet to commend you all on the service. Thanks!
12914,American,@AmericanAir instead they yelled at him and told him to call a number that will not pick up due to call volume
12915,American,@AmericanAir he is at the Boston airport. There is a problem. The agents will not honor the voucher because one number is rubbed out.
12916,American,@AmericanAir See photo of B787 scale model &amp; our PN 320008A wheel deflator specified in Chapter 32 of B787 AMM. http://t.co/kfD4WQRkLW
12917,American,@AmericanAir I guess it is more BS AirportCardio given you cannot have an on time flight
12918,American,@AmericanAir See photo of 787 model &amp; our PN 320008A wheel deflator specified in Chapter 32 of B787 AMM. http://t.co/oilnCfWEyg
12919,American,@AmericanAir you should really explain customer service to your gate agent for 1152 at C4. Couldn't be bothered.
12920,American,"@AmericanAir my wife was on a flt from BRO to TUL via DFW that was Cancelled Flighted. Bought an SWA flight to get her home. Partial refund,DM me plz?"

12928,American,@AmericanAir are pets allowed in first class?
12929,American,"@AmericanAir can lie to you about where your lost bag is, but we are suppose to trust them with our lives thousands of feet in the air..."
12930,American,@AmericanAir Can't help now as all seats have been taken.  There has to be a way to handle high volume of call days.
12931,American,@AmericanAir the worst first class boarding service I ever had.
12932,American,@AmericanAir most disgusting chicken entree I've ever seen.  Your standards have seriously nosedived. #NewAmerican http://t.co/56eSsfOOwt

12934,American,@AmericanAir Am I upgraded on my next flight?

12936,American,"@AmericanAir when changing dest city on an award for a reservation party of 4, is fee $150 for each pax or 150 for first and 25 for rest?"
12937,American,@AmericanAir Delaney and Shawn at DFW showed exceptional customer service today. Will happily choose AA whenever possible now! Thank you!
12938,American,@AmericanAir Another customer non service from you. If we waited for you to solve the problem we would miss the funeral. You suck!
12939,American,@AmericanAir already shared with them. Nothing done!
12940,American,@AmericanAir @kanne822 @SouthwestAir is better than AA.
12941,American,"@AmericanAir I really can't there though to an agent, and I am worried about my reservation. Can you help me out!"

12976,American,"@AmericanAir Hi, did the discount award policy for credit card holders change? No longer seeing the chart of specials on the site. Thanks!"
12977,American,@AmericanAir your seat assignment process when Flight Booking Problems is misleading. I'm not paying extra to select a seat.
12978,American,"@AmericanAir why can't you hire a staff that is helpful, informed and nice to it's customers?"
12979,American,@AmericanAir from the rude ticket counter employees to forcing my wife on standby and then pushing her down the list.. it was a very bad day

12997,American,@AmericanAir thanks. Delivery status??
12998,American,@AmericanAir I don't believe it's acceptable to have a ticket # changed after check in time &amp; not be notified. Apparently that's standard.
12999,American,"@AmericanAir I need to complain to AA, but the email form field doesn't allow enough characters for my complaint. Have a real email address?"
13000,American,@AmericanAir our flight AA 1338 is delayed out of Providenciales and will be missing our connection AA 1651 in Miami to SEA. Who do we call?

13002,American,@AmericanAir we did check before going to de airport and everything was fine. #fail

13006,American,@AmericanAir on Feb. 15th your rep gave me the record locator and told me I'd be receiving an email with the itinerary and confirmation.
13007,American,@AmericanAir This entire process took sooooo long that no decent seats are left.  #customerservice
13008,American,@AmericanAir our flight attendant announced that we have transportation waiting for us for that flight so I think we'll make it.
13009,American,@AmericanAir been on hold to reserve award travel for over 1.5 hrs now. Anyone home?? Or is it a crazy weather issue? http://t.co/cEHrOeurC5
13010,American,@AmericanAir We don't mind the fee! We were told we can't change name on ticket at all.
13011,American,@AmericanAir Thank you!!!! I will be there to pick her up on time.
13012,American,"@AmericanAir the original receipt lists my flight cost as $89ish, and doesn't reflect the use of a voucher"
13013,American,@AmericanAir so whats the hold up on flight 4302?
13014,American,"@AmericanAir Well, you guys are totally kicking a million pounds of ass. Bar none, the best SM team in the airline industry in my opinion."
13015,American,@AmericanAir Least you could do would be to refund me the one-way ticket I had to buy since you weren't able to accommodate. Thank you.
13016,American,"@AmericanAir After being patient about my ""delayed"" bags for 5 weeks, I was told that it could take another 3 to 5 weeks. Unacceptable!"
13017,American,@AmericanAir I had to purchase a ticket that I never would have had to buy had the flight not been Cancelled Flightled. Terrible customer service.
13018,American,"@AmericanAir flt 703, sorry scheduled at 545, phl-mia, a totally chaotic, poorly addressed event.  Sent to three gates in the night"
13019,American,@AmericanAir Was told you could only refund me the cost of my original return flight (note: flight you had booked for me was more expensive)
13020,American,"@AmericanAir Not okay. Since you couldn't put me on an earlier flight, I had to buy my own ticket on another airline."
13021,American,"@AmericanAir Heard back at 7:30 am today, was put on flight tomorrow AM, arriving home at 4 pm. Meaning I'd have to take a 2nd day off work."
13022,American,"@AmericanAir been @ airport 8hrs been told nothing by anyone until now your rep has said ""we are waiting for the mechanics to finish lunch""!"
13023,American,"@AmericanAir Considering it was past midnight, I hung up and called again to receive another service call."
13024,American,@AmericanAir can I redeem AAdavantage miles on LAN flights?
13025,American,"@AmericanAir, I've tried no less than 8 times today to get in touch with your service desk beginning at 8:30 EST.  I'm having no luck -help!"
13026,American,"@AmericanAir Was put on hold for 5.5 hrs then got a call back at 11:20 pm, only to wait on hold for another hour."
13027,American,@AmericanAir You lost a customer today. Flight today was Cancelled Flightled and I had to find out by calling customer service yesterday.
13028,American,"@AmericanAir Just called regarding my bag, came in yesterday and no one notified more or updated the online record locator #customerservice"
13029,American,@AmericanAir to realize your customer service leaves much to be desired and the folks handling the calls could care less...and it shows.
13030,American,@AmericanAir thanks
13031,American,@AmericanAir unacceptable. It's clear losing just one customer doesn't matter to American but how many more bankruptcies will it take
13032,American,@AmericanAir will do on another airline that's more accommodating of its customers. Unable to simply change passengers with notice is simply
13033,American,@AmericanAir is there a probability that flight 1330 from DFW to DTW will be delayed or Cancelled Flighted?
13034,American,@AmericanAir THANK YOU!!! üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç

13037,American,@AmericanAir I've been calling you for 3 straight days and no one picks up. Sure there are storms but there are also #customers Holler!
13038,American,"@americanair Can you tell me where my luggage is? I was on flight 1644 SNA to DFW and my flight to MKE was Cancelled Flightled, so got rebooked to ORD"
13039,American,@AmericanAir it's GTSVYB. It says it's Cancelled Flightled when I try to check.
13040,American,@AmericanAir thank you. They are processing my refund.
13041,American,"@AmericanAir That's good, I'd expect that but I can't get through on the phone to make any changes. Can I change it online?"
13042,American,"@AmericanAir ; @USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Unprofessional, unprepared, unsympathetic, lacked communication, and lacked solutions."
13043,American,"@AmericanAir Thanks for asking On second plane after maintenance issue, for flight from ORD to LIT. Sitting at gate in very very warm plane"
13044,American,"@AmericanAir hey ho its not me losing any money (only you) just next make sure you stick to the ""flyers right's booklet"""

13053,American,@AmericanAir could you check if there is SVU space on AA199 MXP-JFK Feb 28th? Thanks
13054,American,"@AmericanAir Thanks gang! Mind if I ask, do you handle all of your Social Media in house?"
13055,American,@AmericanAir sure is. What's more frustrating is being stranded at the airport with our fate in your hands.
13056,American,@AmericanAir thanks for telling me my flight got Cancelled Flightled when it wasn't. Now I have a missing luggage because of you. Thanks fam!
13057,American,@AmericanAir yes I have. Thanks
13058,American,@AmericanAir 77min still on hold to chg award travel #sorrynotsorry

13067,American,@AmericanAir not helpful
13068,American,"@AmericanAir you expect us to spend our hard earn $ to fly and make exceptions when you have extra call volume, however, you never make acpt"
13069,American,"@AmericanAir but my friend was told she was able to use her credit with the airline towards one of my flights, then was told she couldn't."
13070,American,@AmericanAir hour and a half after landing bags are finally trickling off. http://t.co/4KbTzVjU3b
13071,American,@AmericanAir well you spelled my name wrong.
13072,American,"@AmericanAir 2 hours now!  No I'm not patient.  Why don't you have a call back feature or pay someone to answer the phone, not tweet #onhold"
13073,American,@AmericanAir please do something about boarding at DCA 35X. Many delays + buses to planes on tarmac despite empty gates. Disorganized mess.
13074,American,@AmericanAir no standby line update online or on app either is troubling
13075,American,"@AmericanAir No. Had to Cancelled Flight my trip. Instead of a $25 future trip voucher, a $25 drink coupon would've been better! #WakingInMemphis"
13076,American,"@AmericanAir thx, just sent the DM"
13077,American,@AmericanAir Unbelievable that I cannot even wait on hold to speak to a human being to resolve my issue!!!!!!!! The system simply hangs up!
13078,American,@americanair thanks to your airline I now have a ruined bag and you refuse to do anything about it.
13079,American,@AmericanAir 4 open kiosks for priority with no line and only 4 open for main check in for ~80-100 ppl

13081,American,@AmericanAir Thank u! Did reach out to both and have not had a response yet. Lost and Found goes straight to VM.
13082,American,"@AmericanAir ""bag has not yet been located"". Again, 5th time I've checked it. How can tracking my bag be this hard for your system?"
13083,American,@AmericanAir FYI...call stilling getting dropped.  After an hour of continuous dialing. Attempted to Cancelled Flight online but not able to. HELP!!!

13086,American,@AmericanAir Kudos to the crew of Flt 167 today. Specially to Carlton. Loved your new 767-300. Keep up the good work AA!
13087,American,@AmericanAir are flights leaving Dallas right now? In Maui trying to figure out how delayed flight 7 is going to be
13088,American,"@AmericanAir, ask your new colleagues @USAirways how they handled US 728 on 21 Feb. I expect to be made whole again. Check complaint inbox."
13089,American,@AmericanAir get me outta here
13090,American,@americanair just tried calling. got a high call volume at this moment message and then it said goodbye and hung up‚Ä¶
13091,American,@AmericanAir really appreciate the great customer service... One of your service agents just hung up on me when asking legitimate questions
13092,American,@AmericanAir don't they already know ?  Isn't everyone sharing how nasty the food is? It's not even close to decent.
13093,American,@AmericanAir Thank you. It's much appreciated. We have been on the plane for 90 min now at the gate.
13094,American,@AmericanAir did you guys get rid of the functionality on http://t.co/R1OQAVEO7I to put a reservation on hold for 24 hours? i don't see it
13095,American,"@AmericanAir On hold since 5am. When no one can get to the airport, Cancelled Flight flight, don't make us pay huge fee to change flight."
13096,American,@AmericanAir All of the nicest people in the world work at Admiral's clubs. Gladys in San Juan es mi Amiga
13097,American,@AmericanAir due to road conditions
13098,American,@AmericanAir I was going to change it to tomorrow because I am concerned if the fllight does make I won't be able to leave the airport   1/2
13099,American,"@AmericanAir I love very much your planes, can you please follow me back? It's an amazing bussines!"
13100,American,"@AmericanAir so if your genuine, give me your opinion  on what occurred last night 445 fly  from phl, to mia. No assistance at airport"
13101,American,@AmericanAir How can I get a flight change while in the air? Delays causing a missed connection again. There is 1 seat for Late Flightr
13102,American,@AmericanAir I think 2 weeks of waiting is more than enough time for you to contact me.  This is why you lose customers
13103,American,"@AmericanAir Way to suck at customer service, Dallas is trapped in an ice storm but you didn't Cancelled Flight 7am flight &amp; been on hold all day."
13104,American,@AmericanAir umm unexpected?? Unexpected meaning you guys didn't know you had a major staff shortage ??
13105,American,@AmericanAir Also do you have any way to speak to someone on the phone? Your 1-800 # has been hanging up on me all day.
13106,American,@AmericanAir SFO. Natt (the agent who helped me) really did an awesome job.
13107,American,@AmericanAir I paid seat upgrade b4 the severe weather.  Got booked on another flight but did not get upgrade. Was calling to inquire. HELP!

13110,American,"@AmericanAir Thanks. Having issues checking in for flight, please check our DM convo for more info."
13111,American,@AmericanAir You don't care about keeping your customers safe or at least you didn't care about my sister
13112,American,@AmericanAir maybe you should stop tweeting and start calling. Or make it available for people to wait on-hold instead of hanging up on us.
13113,American,"@AmericanAir, that's not the point. Say its $1300 at the counter when I clearly see $500 on your site? AA agent was @ a loss 4 words, too"
13114,American,@AmericanAir When will callers from the East Coast be able to speak to an actual human for reservation support? All agents busy call Late Flightr..
13115,American,@AmericanAir My father loved working for you as well as PanAm
13116,American,@AmericanAir 249 EWR - DFW is now stopping BNA to refuel 4 bad weather? Are YOU just trying to get the plane closer 2 DFW then Cancelled Flight on us?
13117,American,"@AmericanAir is there something wrong with the website? no matter what flight I select, it says it's no longer available."

13120,American,@AmericanAir we have been sitting on the plane for over an hour. unacceptable. you have a complete disregard for customer service.

13193,American,@AmericanAir you need to have a look at your handling of flight 106 and 104. Company of yours size should have protocols in place to help

13219,American,@AmericanAir I've been trying to call your reservations desk for past 12 hours and can't get through.  This is not what I expected.
13220,American,@AmericanAir customer service is terrible.Been waiting 6 weeks for a reply to an email. Not helpful at all and keep brushing off problems!
13221,American,@AmericanAir it's taken care of already. I've come to expect this level of horrible service from you time and time again
13222,American,@americanair why am I not being given a callback option??! Why has this service been turned off?

13347,American,@AmericanAir can you?
13348,American,@AmericanAir Could have voided the ticket since it was &gt; 24hrs since Flight Booking Problems. Are you going to waive the fees? Still can't get through.
13349,American,"@AmericanAir - So does that mean your other flights going into Buffalo from other locations, you don't care about their safety?"
13350,American,"@AmericanAir I've been in line for over half hour trying to see a representative, now I might even miss the next flight too, unacceptable"

13380,American,"@AmericanAir Supervisor M.Robinson just served a lot of attitude, Cancelled Flighted my flight out of spite, then put me back on on #crazybitch"
13381,American,@AmericanAir at gate c11. Your gate agents are turning paying customers away in favor of non revs
13382,American,@AmericanAir the one at 11:30am? My app still shows it as on time!
13383,American,@AmericanAir @andyellwood @delk lol. I was sure I'd wake up to more of a response than this half-thought auto tweet. hope you made it out.
13384,American,"@AmericanAir AA2334 Second week in a row delayed, due to mechanical issues. All the sleet outside and yet we're stuck changing a tire"

13388,American,@AmericanAir Will do. Appreciate the replies though.
13389,American,@AmericanAir although there was a 6 hour delay every single staff member from the ticket desk to the admirals club in was as sweet as pie
13390,American,@AmericanAir how are the runways at DFW? Will you be flying Late Flightr today? Thanks.
13391,American,@AmericanAir BRING MY FIANC√â @meerikangas BACK TO ME!
13392,American,@AmericanAir hahahaha! This is crazy! Well here's to another night at the airport!!
13393,American,@AmericanAir Kudos to ticket agents for #2224 for making passengers check bags that are too big to fit in overhead.
13394,American,"@AmericanAir but you're not sorry enough to compensate for either the extended time or cost difference to an alternate direct flight, right?"
13395,American,@AmericanAir @hoagy10 how about you stop cutting and pasting apologies and get some additional phone reps to do their jobs
13396,American,@AmericanAir work would be much better with my lesson plans and music for my classes today.
13397,American,@AmericanAir your call system is a fucking joke
13398,American,@AmericanAir at LAX &amp; just got off the phone w/reservations. Every flight that'd get me to BOS before 11 am tmrw is apparently unavailable üòê
13399,American,@AmericanAir are you anticipating weather-reLate Flightd Cancelled Flightations for afternoon departures out of AUS today?
13400,American,@AmericanAir No worries. Don't blame you for weather.
13401,American,@AmericanAir You moved us onto 6.55pm but there is availability on 1.50 and 3.30.   No answer on your phone. Have young children.  HELP!
13402,American,"@AmericanAir It's our honeymoon,I paid extra business. I was sitting next to my bride, you bumped me because of status. Disgusted"
13403,American,@AmericanAir Deplaned for the 3rd fucking time. Fuck you AA.
13404,American,@AmericanAir how do I redeem a travel voucher for a flight if I can't reach a travel agent by phone? My hold expires in 24 hours
13405,American,"@AmericanAir Thanks, but that results in missing the conference I'm attending. Are there options to book earlier,or if not,receive a refund?"
13406,American,@AmericanAir it has been almost 4 hours and I have heard nothing yet from your reservations team. What am I supposed to do?
13407,American,"@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight due to ""weather"" when others are flying out just fine.  No compensation, no resolution.  Incompetent."
13408,American,@AmericanAir 8 hours on the phone yesterday.  Really?  Still doesn't pick up status on US Air flight.
13409,American,@AmericanAir I need to be back in Cleveland as early as possible tomorrow
13410,American,@AmericanAir worst experience ever. @VirginAmerica all the way!
13411,American,@AmericanAir calling at 1am to tell me my flight has been rescheduled 12 hours Late Flightr than it was supposed be to seems like a bad solution
13412,American,"@AmericanAir I fail to see how telling a caller that a bag may take ""18 hours"" to get from JFK to Brooklyn is ""the best we can"""
13413,American,@AmericanAir thanks to Jacqueline in CLT for cleaning up @amexserve and @USAirways mess!!! Awesome service
13414,American,@AmericanAir it's not about the weather. It's about the fact that I can't get ahold of anyone to help. BUT you can tweet me back.
13415,American,@AmericanAir please message me for assistance - can't get through to anyone.
13416,American,@AmericanAir - trying to track down backs for two of my attendees #help
13417,American,@AmericanAir I've witnessed a manager named Denise yell at 2 different customers with my same issue. #rude
13418,American,@AmericanAir how comes no one has answered my calls or emails?
13419,American,@AmericanAir at LAX and your service reps just hand out the 800 number to call. So that's not helpful.
13420,American,"@AmericanAir Extend rtn flight to bereavement, 22nd I could have change fee dropped, now told no.Worse day of my life #badcustomerservice"
13421,American,@AmericanAir I've tried ten times now last night and this morning...how many times should I try? Have meetings to make tonight in ATX.
13422,American,@AmericanAir does that mean my ktn is not in my reservation?
13423,American,@AmericanAir thanks for responding ... will do!
13424,American,"@AmericanAir Thanks that was done, I just don't understand why those whose bags couldn't fit aren't notified in air/at landing #technology"
13425,American,@AmericanAir  I have still not talked to anyone. You guys should be prepared for these situations. How is this good service? I am so mad!!!
13426,American,@AmericanAir ok thank you. What if I can't get a hold of someone to get a new flight?
13427,American,@AmericanAir #horriblecustomerservice # rudestaff # incompetentmanagers

13432,American,@AmericanAir this is the biggest joke of #customerservice I've ever seen from a  ‚úàÔ∏è brand http://t.co/XHSUUpHeZe
13433,American,"@AmericanAir it would be awfully nice if you could send an alert when my flight is Cancelled Flighted. No text, no email, no love..."
13434,American,@AmericanAir Thanks. Took care of it. Issue was IVR was unclear and took too long to get a call-back option. Would love to see that fixed.
13435,American,@AmericanAir thank you so much that helps a lot.
13436,American,"@AmericanAir I understand that, but I'm not even being put on hold - it says ""try again Late Flightr, goodbye""."
13437,American,@AmericanAir I do not need an apology. I need you to fix it in a competent manner.
13438,American,@AmericanAir I like the call back system. But thought you'd like to know it's not working well. I received three calls but there's no audio.
13439,American,@AmericanAir I need to be back home tomorrow and no one is helping me. Please help me rebook for a flight tomorrow!
13440,American,@AmericanAir Filed a PIR with an agent at Indianapolis airport. Unable to pull up information online on your site. Have DMed details.
13441,American,"@AmericanAir I hear #Delta is offering 2,500 miles to frequent flyers if their bags doesn't come out within 20 minutes of landing thoughts?"

13446,American,"@AmericanAir my flight was Cancelled Flightled yesterday early afternoon, so why did you call me at 1230am and 230am to wake me up and tell me?!"

13448,American,@AmericanAir I put a call back in at 1AM and still nothing at 8AM. You think you might get back to me?
13449,American,@AmericanAir is there anyone online that can help... the flight leaves in 3 hrs
13450,American,@AmericanAir why Cancelled Flight #1605 on 6/25 &amp; 6/28? Flights now 4 hrs longer &amp;  have layovers. Too Late Flight to find a reasonably priced alternative.
13451,American,@AmericanAir I don't know who that may be. I was also working from home. Thanks for nothing.
13452,American,@AmericanAir I called the EP line and 4 hours Late Flightr I was called back.  I sat on hold for over a hour to US Airways and then cut off
13453,American,@AmericanAir my flight 1106 was Cancelled Flightled and I need to get back to Cleveland. What are my options?
13454,American,@AmericanAir is there any way you could put me up in a hotel for the night?? If not I'm having to sleep at the airport again tonight.
13455,American,"@AmericanAir @MallowFairy And how many times, exactly, should we call and leave our number for a call back? Because that hasn't worked."
13456,American,.@AmericanAir @C2Next Would be great to get some help too! I've been trying since last night to get through.
13457,American,"@AmericanAir Telling frustrated customers ""we are super busy, please call back Late Flightr kthxbai"" and then hanging up is not the best practice."

13459,American,@AmericanAir Not even on the bag status...will take actions against this company is incredible how irresponsible are with the costumer
13460,American,@AmericanAir Still waiting news about my bags 48hrs already happened and this company don't give to the passengers any certain information
13461,American,@AmericanAir Your customer service sucks! You rep should not be yelling at a caller regarding the weather in DFW.  Hope you go bankrupt!
13462,American,@AmericanAir Phone just disconnects if you stay on the line. Need to checkout of hotel in 2 hrs &amp; have no place to go. Can't keep calling.
13463,American,@AmericanAir do you know if there is wifi on this flight? If so how much is it? Thank you :-)
13464,American,@AmericanAir no apologies required. I made it home safe thanks to you! Kudos to AA!
13465,American,@AmericanAir requested a call back at 1am. My Cancelled Flighted flight through DFW shouldn't take this long to reroute. You're Customer Service lacks
13466,American,@AmericanAir will you review your systems re notification? The website and telephone systems you have in place are clearly inadequate.
13467,American,@AmericanAir Why not sell MCE during post door-close shuffle in same way u sell drinks/snacks? People on my flight self-upgraded w/o paying.
13468,American,@AmericanAir Will 2396 be Cancelled Flightled tonight?

13472,American,@AmericanAir Why did I have to stand at baggage claim for an hour waiting for a bag that you knew never made it on to the plane?

13474,American,@AmericanAir Not very helpful if my flight is already Cancelled Flightled! What about reFlight Booking Problems? AA has my email and cell - yet no notifications.
13475,American,"@AmericanAir @derekc21 , I leave Jaipur tomorrow , back to Dehli , Only in Delhi  one night .  we need to  use our abilities to make magic ."

13498,American,"@AmericanAir all right, but can you give me an email to write to ?"
13499,American,@AmericanAir is DFW accepting any arrivals or departures today?

13513,American,@AmericanAir How is it possible that your call system can refuse callers for over twelve hours? What service options does that leave?
13514,American,"@AmericanAir I understand a bit of a wait, but I called at 6:23 pm and didn't get a call back until just after 11:00 pm, that's not cool"
13515,American,@AmericanAir  @SouthwestAir  ‚Äî Y'all will like this one. http://t.co/hF8aJZ4ffl

13530,American,.@AmericanAir @Kaha58 Would be nice if you could actually talk to the reserv. team...it just hangs up on you and has been since last night.
13531,American,@AmericanAir why is there only one checkpoint open at JFK terminal 8? Ridiculous.
13532,American,@AmericanAir wow. Flight crew shows up :15 mins before the flight. No catering for AA3390. Nice. Why to treat your customers.
13533,American,@AmericanAir.If I miss saying goodbye to my friend cause of your crappy service I swear you will never hear the end of it.#AmericanAirlines

13631,American,"@AmericanAir How best to talk with an agent to reschedule Cancelled Flighted flight? No one answers at AA. Know it's busy, but need help.Thanks"
13632,American,@AmericanAir I don't want to waste any more of my time on your airline (you've already robbed 21 hours of my day) but I definitely will.
13633,American,@AmericanAir me because it might not be so urgent for you but it really is for me. (5)

13647,American,@AmericanAir Why did  AA973 return to JFK? Thanks :)
13648,American,@AmericanAir is the 24/7 phone line open? On hold for over 2 hours now. Your check-in agents cannot help at the airport itself. Please help.
13649,American,@AmericanAir what sense is it to charge for a bag service when the service isn't great. Losing luggage and now missing items this is bs
13650,American,@AmericanAir No it isn't -  sheer incompetence was reigning at DFW today. I was there. On a plane on the GD runway. I doubt you were.
13651,American,"@AmericanAir yes we did make it home. But by no means am I happy. I've always chosen AA as my 1st choice when flying, I'm rethinking that..."
13652,American,@AmericanAir still waiting on a dm response..... #sloooowresponses
13653,American,@AmericanAir @robinreda that can be a stop over before Paris. You are an embarrassment
13654,American,@AmericanAir @robinreda being stuck two days in the airport is not something pretty normal. I am positive you can find a plane to Europe
13655,American,@AmericanAir highly disappointed in the baggage service with this merge with @USAirways you guys have lost our 1st bag and now missing items
13656,American,@AmericanAir just landed - 3hours Late Flight - and now we need to wait TWENTY MORE MINUTES for a gate!  I have patience but none for incompetence.
13657,American,@AmericanAir FINALLY called me back... BUT HASN'T SPOKEN TO ME.  Like the worst prank call EVER!!
13658,American,"@AmericanAir wait times of 2 hours to talk with an exec plt agent, what is going on!!!"
13659,American,@AmericanAir so the one time we upgrade to first class our luggage was open and now missing valuable items that can't be replaced. #upset

13687,American,@AmericanAir The word failure means: an act or instance of failing or proving unsuccessful; lack of success nonperformance of something due.

13689,American,@AmericanAir do you have the phone number of a supervisor i can speak to regarding my travels today

13710,American,@AmericanAir wasn't offered a flight out of PHL until TUESDAY so had to ask to be booked to Houston instead of Austin.
13711,American,"@AmericanAir will do. I'd think, though, that a literally identical itinerary to your sample itineraries would work - maybe need to update?"

13726,American,@AmericanAir please DM me a way to get in touch with someone that can help. I'm platinum AA and considering quitting AA BC of this.
13727,American,@AmericanAir thanks for following up. I think it's fair to refund the ticket price and the two one way rental cars I had to buy.
13728,American,@AmericanAir it was my friend. She shouldn't have been scheduled so close together at LAX then not reimbursed. It's costing her 12 hrs &amp;$250

13872,American,@AmericanAir due to gate agents I missed my connecting flight to Mexico City...not a happy customer AA- let's correct this
13873,American,@AmericanAir she doesn't have Twitter.
13874,American,@AmericanAir at some point u need to tell passengers what is going on. At Jfk waiting to get on flight it is a mess.
13875,American,"@AmericanAir its not that, it's the rude agent who wouldn't listen to anything I would say and it clearly fit into the sizer"
13876,American,"@AmericanAir seriously, I do not want to wait 24 hours for a flight when I have to prepare for a family funeral."
13877,American,"@AmericanAir your gate agents at DFW gate B16 are pathetic tonight.  Terrible communication, stories changing and apathetic"
13878,American,@AmericanAir I was worried when my bag went SAN to DCA 24 hours before me. But our reunion was an organized  breeze! http://t.co/uOARyQ98PU
13879,American,"@AmericanAir yea no worries. I'm just going home to Denver. Not your fault, weather sucks bad."
13880,American,@AmericanAir I've been tryin to use my voucher to book a flight the last 2days. Lines are busy. Plse help me?The flight may go up.
13881,American,"@AmericanAir Yes, thanks for checking. Very cramped, but got on &amp; made it safely. Flying back tomorrow at 1pm. http://t.co/CSddCCMvbD"
13882,American,@AmericanAir  is the worst airline to ever travel with!!!! The worst!! They're equivalent to DIRT!!!!!!
13883,American,@AmericanAir great flight experience again... SFO-JFK... Dare I say it? A consistent high quality on a legacy airline? Keep it up guys!
13884,American,@AmericanAir pretty bad at #DFW no updates two flights behind doors open breeze no America airlines workers http://t.co/6MBK79mdnW
13885,American,@AmericanAir Great - thank you.
13886,American,@AmericanAir yes and the auto rebook confirmed an outbound that departs after the return flight.  # fire the software programmers
13887,American,@AmericanAir I'm getting calls from 1-800-433-7300 but the calls seem to drop instantly. Is there any alternate avenue for resched. support?
13888,American,@AmericanAir Supposed to arrive at my destination tonight. American rebooks me for Wednesday? Where am I staying until then?
13889,American,@AmericanAir @USAirways how can you have no food on a 4 hour flight 528 from Columbus to Phoenix? Starving and Pissed off. Can't eat Go Go!
13890,American,"@AmericanAir jal and cathay pacific so no, I can't do it online."
13891,American,@AmericanAir what is the status of flight 1675 tomorrow
13892,American,@AmericanAir 4828 but I just missed it because no one is at the gate to marshall us in so now I have to rent a car &amp; drive 5 hrs. So thanks.
13893,American,@AmericanAir The pilot told us they would release bags as well as offer hotel vouchers. Neither happened.
13894,American,@AmericanAir my understanding is they were able and did for many other flights but chose not to for this one.
13895,American,@AmericanAir Hey so I'm very disappointed with my time traveling with you! I've had the worst experience and both times the flight delayed!
13896,American,@AmericanAir 37 minutes??????
13897,American,@AmericanAir  having trouble getting rebooked
13898,American,"@AmericanAir I understand. I'm feeling cranky. I called AA's bag tracker number and heard ""your bag has not been located."" üò©"
13899,American,@AmericanAir AA45 ... JFK to LAS.
13900,American,@AmericanAir I'm willing to hold for an agent. you aren't being helpful you keep hanging up on me #americanairsucks #hiremorepoeple
13901,American,"@AmericanAir I have been trying to speak with an agent the whole day about my Cancelled Flightled flight, what I can do?"
13902,American,@AmericanAir Need to go frm TPA to MCI tmrw &amp; my connection thru DFW is Cancelled Flightled. Can u connect me thru a diff city? Been on hold for 2 hrs
13903,American,@americanair Any hints to get through to and stay connected with you to rearrange weather reLate Flightd Cancelled Flights? Hours in now w/nothing.
13904,American,@AmericanAir no gate agent after 30 minutes to let us off the plane???? WTW / grounds crew is here / hope you're ready to cover my delay
13905,American,@AmericanAir You can't even get someone on the phone. Great story for the media.
13906,American,"‚Äú@AmericanAir:  ""Jason, you'll end up missing your connection. Please see our DFW agents for assistance.‚Äù Nope! Hasn't taken off yet, still!"
13907,American,@AmericanAir finally made it to chicago - 13 hours Late Flight.  Did get a $12 food voucher for my wait.about $1per/hr. Never again. Good bye.
13908,American,@AmericanAir instead of putting the burden on your customers do the right thing and get more gate agents.
13909,American,@AmericanAir guys 5350 in dfw  stuck at the gate for half an hour.  Do we pull the slide or what?
13910,American,@AmericanAir plz kys I have been sitting in this plane for an hour I want to leave
13911,American,@AmericanAir after all that weve been through today as a courtesy to not allow a passenger with an oxgen tank sit up there is bad business
13912,American,@AmericanAir Now you've Cancelled Flightled my flight. First a priority ticket bumped and now this. You're losing customers. People are furious.
13913,American,@americanair I finally got someone on the phone so no worries!
13914,American,@AmericanAir it that you say is going to help us? Give me a number to call that isn't a recording w a 2 hour wait time!
13915,American,@AmericanAir ok. Pilots are looking for agents  - they jumped out / FLT 5350 #DFW / this is crazy
13916,American,@AmericanAir no you're not you're trying to book me PAST when i need 2 arrive but you're still selling seats on the day I'm trying 2 travel
13917,American,@AmericanAir because you won't get our bags for us because you said they would go on to Cincinnati even though we can't. Who exactly is
13918,American,@AmericanAir you all should really be ashamed. The entire business class cabin is empty and almost all of first class...
13919,American,@AmericanAir You could only get us on a flight 30 minutes before the funeral starts. We're stranded in Dallas w/o luggage for 2 days
13920,American,"@AmericanAir just Cancelled Flightled my 7 am flight tomorrow with out informing me at all today, then booked one in 2 days, and no customer service"
13921,American,"@AmericanAir Thanks - I note some, but not all, flights are Cancelled Flightled - are only some aircraft/runways working out of DFW today/tomorrow?"
13922,American,@AmericanAir we knew it was not going to leave but we had 6 hours waiting... that was the hurry..
13923,American,@AmericanAir we tried. We are headed to a funeral in Cincinnati and your people didn't even tell us we could get on standby.
13924,American,@AmericanAir they don't even give an option to hold.. Just say lines are busy Plz try Late Flightr
13925,American,@AmericanAir i will be writing a very detailed letter to you all about this experience today. I have never experienced such awful cs ever
13926,American,"@AmericanAir The delay is nothing but the personnel being so combative up to the point of saying ""what's the hury,  the plane is not leaving"
13927,American,@AmericanAir delta rerouted 6 of my bags onto aa977 MIA-CUR. How can I see if they made it onto the flight?
13928,American,@AmericanAir would have been nice if the agents were at the very least courteous since the delay was AA's fault
13929,American,@AmericanAir Your logo looks like 3D glasses.
13930,American,@AmericanAir no private msg me and will provide details...u really need customer svc training for your staff
13931,American,@AmericanAir and let FLT 2350 know I'm coming / gate crew have yet to arrive to let us off FLT 5350 #DFW
13932,American,@AmericanAir you guys should really improve the service experience with your on site personnel. This has been one of the worst experiences.
13933,American,@AmericanAir @Expedia are killing me. Over 3 hours to get NO human to help me.
13934,American,@AmericanAir 1 ticket agent servicing at least 60 people on line. Waiting for an hour and a half and your phones hang up on people.
13935,American,"@AmericanAir yeah, rebooked for tomorrow morning. But extremely disappointed to miss a wedding."
13936,American,@AmericanAir #americanview New paint scheme looks great! #usairways http://t.co/Gt6umHbh43
13937,American,"@AmericanAir thanks for the call on my Cancelled Flightled flight, NOT!  Flight Booking Problems me for Tues no good weather caused me 2 leave early"
13938,American,"@AmericanAir on plane for JFK-&gt;SFO, been sitting here for 1.5 hours waiting for push crew, how is this acceptable?"
13939,American,@AmericanAir waiting for you to pick up... Coming up on 3 hours now... http://t.co/nOPq5xIsbS

13943,American,@AmericanAir thank you for the update!
13944,American,@AmericanAir pathetic service
13945,American,@AmericanAir Dallas/Fort Worth flight number 5320
13946,American,"@AmericanAir oh it can get better apparently. After making us wait for a gate, psych!! Now we need you to de-ice before coming to the gate!!"
13947,American,@AmericanAir if you could get the gate crew to help us off FLT 5350 that would be great....
13948,American,@AmericanAir is the situation at JFK this evening is going to get better or worse ? Do not Cancelled Flight a flight like yesterday after 8h delayed
13949,American,@AmericanAir ya but u weren't sitting on the plane.
13950,American,@AmericanAir I know you can't control weather but you can control how you treat customers..#shafted
13951,American,@AmericanAir I have tried to talk to someone for almost 6 hrs! you Cancelled Flightled my flight and you won't pick up the phone. pathetic &amp; very sad
13952,American,@AmericanAir yes. He's in the next flight

13954,American,"@AmericanAir my wife's flight is Cancelled Flightled, told to call. No one answers. How do we book a flight? Help us please"

13956,American,@AmericanAir hi my flight to DFW 2463 was Cancelled Flightled tonight. Called in and left my number for call back it's been 3hrs please help.
13957,American,"@AmericanAir Hi, I have my name, email, and AAdvantage #, but website won't let me reset password. Can we troubleshoot together? Thanks!"
13958,American,@AmericanAir Still looking as we speak.
13959,American,"@AmericanAir we're on AA1401 landed at 8:55pm in Miami, but waiting for a gate. Can someone on your team help us out?!"
13960,American,@AmericanAir - where are my bags? Baggage claim C25 or C26 (flt# 959)?? I can see the plane from here? Why does it take 25 min???
13961,American,"@AmericanAir is there only one call centre? I know it's busy right now, really need to speak to agent not computer"
13962,American,@AmericanAir you guys fail again.. all I need to do is use my voucher for a ticket but I can't do it online #yourphonesystemsucks
13963,American,@AmericanAir Shout-out to all the ground crews working in the cold! Thanks for what y'all do. (&amp; social media team for customer service)
13964,American,@AmericanAir I fortunately was not on that flight - just in the same waiting area / impressed w how he handled the stressful situation
13965,American,"@AmericanAir we've been on hold for over 4 hrs, you Cancelled Flighted flt 2222 phl-dfw. Need assistance!!!"

13967,American,@AmericanAir their flights into Buffalo as well -- You were the only flight Cancelled Flightled!!!
13968,American,"@AmericanAir -- This is after you Cancelled Flightled our flight into Buffalo because of ""weather"" and lied to us and said other airlines Cancelled Flightled"
13969,American,"@AmericanAir know that I could use that for a flight into Canada.  By they time they figured it out, it was too Late Flight to check our bags"
13970,American,@AmericanAir dropping the ball. Again. No catering. Plane switch. No gate attendant. 2 hours Late Flight. Really nice.
13971,American,@AmericanAir its Adolfo Garcia
13972,American,"@AmericanAir My friend needs some help on her flt (she's not on Twiiter), can I DM you her info?"
13973,American,"@AmericanAir my flight from VCP to JFK was delayed and now it has been Cancelled Flighted, what should i do?"
13974,American,@AmericanAir hats off to Admiral Lounge attendant @ YYZ Terminal 3 who gave her banana to our toddler when none avail elsewhere.
13975,American,"@AmericanAir ""We'll drop off your luggage 24 hours after your flight"" is ridiculous."
13976,American,@AmericanAir thanks. Bummer. Poor planning on my part. I assume the card in Passbook won't work either?
13977,American,"@AmericanAir You should be more timely with bags that missed a flight, people need their undies the next morning!"
13978,American,@AmericanAir I tried that. They won't book us with another airline. I wish I had flown with you! We are now stuck in FL til Weds.
13979,American,@AmericanAir  A true #AmericanView ...The National Mall http://t.co/N7ExdbcRHg
13980,American,"@vanessaannz seriously, you hate @AmericanAir since they can't accommodate you due to inclemental  weather disruptions? lol, very funny"
13981,American,@AmericanAir gotta be worse than @delta w/ on time departures.  I rushed back to terminal C for 8:25 flight but they haven't strtd boarding.
13982,American,@AmericanAir I know you are getting pummeled tonight @dfwairport we were one of the lucky out of @slcairport just one more @AUStinAirport
13983,American,@AmericanAir And gold status too.
13984,American,@AmericanAir In car gng to DFW. Pulled over 1hr ago - very icy roads. On-hold with AA since 1hr. Can't reach arpt for AA2450. Wat 2 do?
13985,American,@AmericanAir was told at 7pm my bags would 1000% be at my house by 9pm. Well they're not and I continue to be lied to.
13986,American,@AmericanAir won't answer the reservation line!  Nice service.  We may be stuck...
13987,American,@AmericanAir It's not your agents; it's your voice activated system that's not working right. And no email on Cancelled Flightlation. Lots of problems
13988,American,"@AmericanAir I was on flt 2222 tomorrow, they moved me to 750. I need it moved to Tuesday. the roads won't be better for flight 750. thanks"
13989,American,@AmericanAir I'm on #1058 tmrw from CUN DFW. Final dest'n is ORD. Seeing freezing rain in DFW all morning. Should I change my connection?
13990,American,@AmericanAir no other (what should be valid) Circle Pacific itineraries can be booked either - always makes all US dest. invalid 4 last leg
13991,American,@AmericanAir I am trying to add my tsa pre check number to my reservation online and don't see an option to do that..?? #nosecuritylines
13992,American,@AmericanAir you have the poorest trained employees at these desks. I haven't even started to discuss the #lostluggage yet
13993,American,@AmericanAir none of your sample itineraries can actually be booked http://t.co/mF7rABGn8a Every last leg back to US says invalid
13994,American,@AmericanAir I'm booked for Tuesday night. 60 degrees in Alabama right now. I'm good. Stay warm and safe.
13995,American,@AmericanAir So plot thickens. We're on plane but no ground crew to get us off gate. Apparently under the weather in large numbers....
13996,American,@AmericanAir  800 number will not even let you wait for next customer rep. Very frustrating. Can't talk to humans.
13997,American,@AmericanAir what happened?? We didn't get a notification about a departure Cancelled Flightation tomorrow. Why will it take 2 hrs to talk to someone
13998,American,@AmericanAir you set a schedule try and keep it !!! #AAALWAYSLate Flight
13999,American,"@AmericanAir @derekc21 , to my surprise  BA doesn't  have  me registered in the system , I was getting hopeful :(, Lets step it up , Okay ?"
14000,American,@AmericanAir Unfortunately that is not true. A robot apologizes and hangs up. So how do I get help?
14001,American,"@AmericanAir Thanks for the reply, but a functioning plane four hours ago was the only way to do that. The staff was friendly, tho."
14002,American,Thank you for sending more details  @AmericanAir: They're pretty handy dandy. more info here: http://t.co/FvlxIRh1F1 #LookforwardtoflywithAA
14003,American,@AmericanAir aa223 being ignored
14004,American,"@AmericanAir FYI twice now I've tried the ""we'll call you when someone is free"" thing. Both times it called, I picked up, then it hung up."
14005,American,@AmericanAir that's the number I called -it wouldn't let me speak to an agent because of the issues with weather today
14006,American,@AmericanAir usually raving about the service to LAX. Your nbr1 and helper can't figure out how to hang a coat and serve a drink. 6F
14007,American,"@AmericanAir @MO3TVida just so you know, reservations team has a 2+ hr callback time"
14008,American,@AmericanAir what do kids aged 11 and 12 need to fly with AA internally within the usa. Thanks for confirming
14009,American,@AmericanAir absolute terrible service to schedule a 40 minute layover and then not let someone on the plane with the door not closed.
14010,American,"@AmericanAir I didn't miss my flight.  American Airlines gave my ticket, as well as 6 other passengers tickets away. Not my fault."
14011,American,@AmericanAir Please help AA 2258 Monday Cancelled Flightled.  Can you advise on reFlight Booking Problems / refund.  Have children and need to make plans now
14012,American,@AmericanAir DM sent. Answer me please
14013,American,"@AmericanAir I really want to get home. Tonight, preferably. Please stop delaying my plane üò¢üòïüò¶ #AmericanAirlines"
14014,American,@AmericanAir is profiting in the billions and throwing crap at the people who put them there. American is a hurting brand
14015,American,@AmericanAir I've never witnessed such covert tactics from an airline.
14016,American,@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my wife's flight and she has to call but your service won't even let us. Going on 7 hours now.
14017,American,@AmericanAir it shouldn't happen but did and has put us and our gear in jeopardy. What steps do you take to protect customers if their items
14018,American,@AmericanAir American Airlines.
14019,American,@AmericanAir all of these issues are not based on weather or things that are out of your control. These  issues are based on negligence.
14020,American,@AmericanAir the worst air experience I have ever had and I am not in the first plane yet.
14021,American,@AmericanAir I just DMed you
14022,American,@AmericanAir why is it most first class passengers now request the sand which from coach ?
14023,American,@AmericanAir @DAI_President Good luck at DFW this evening AA!
14024,American,@AmericanAir so we have a Cancelled Flightled flight in about twelve hours. Maybe we'll have heard from an AA rep at that point.
14025,American,"@AmericanAir on hold for 3 hours...got an agent, immediately txfd me to change cncdld flight...told it would be 1 min, 80 min Late Flightr, waiting"
14026,American,@AmericanAir Awesome customer service on #390 from rdu. They snuck my wife a warm cookie. Thx!
14027,American,@AmericanAir flight attendants on AA2402 were spectacular.Fed the ENTIRE cabin then food from coach. Why do you keep serving this vile food
14028,American,"@AmericanAir @CineDrones I just wish that a team member would pick up the phone at this point, let alone be courteous or helpful üò≥"
14029,American,"@americanair seriously, pls pls bring more people up to help us! There are still flights to ORD frm DFW and I want in http://t.co/o3CjsVSsqF"
14030,American,@AmericanAir @carlw1980 I have followed and dm'd you. . . Please respond to my concern too. Really disappointed with customer service.
14031,American,"@AmericanAir  To add, I have to get up to go to work tomorrow am.  I don't like having to wait up until 12 or Late Flightr.  CS sucks."
14032,American,"@AmericanAir just when I thought you guys were done messing up, you make it worse. Your airline ruins hopes and dreams."
14033,American,@AmericanAir Flight 1512 (N924AN) departs @FlyTPA enroute to @dfwairport http://t.co/j0mhMkDiVl
14034,American,@AmericanAir approaching three hours sitting in the plane on the ground at DFW on #AmericanAirlines flight 3056 - Oscar performance
14035,American,"@AmericanAir - We have; they were useless. Baggage service called before 9 to tell us we would have bags by 3. Now, maybe midnight."
14036,American,@AmericanAir checking into a flight on your website is about as easy as asking a bear to shit in a toilet #justsaying
14037,American,@AmericanAir makes some small improvements and retains their program they win all. They keep the crappy food and change advantage they lose
14038,American,@AmericanAir AA 2258 why have you Cancelled Flightled our flight without courtesy of notifying us or alternatives?  Very poor.
14039,American,@AmericanAir how have you not loaded our luggage on the plane and were OVER an hour delayed? #Flight293
14040,American,@AmericanAir I spent $600 on my flight. Could have gone on @united for $382 but their mileage program sucks.
14041,American,"@americanair Plz bring more agents up to DFW AA Cstmr srvc ctr gates A, there are only 2 agents and 100+ ppl... http://t.co/uCvEU2hurZ"
14042,American,@AmericanAir the food served on AA2402 was vile and gross.The entire cabin did not eat their meal. Survey the flight crew. Another gross out
14043,American,@AmericanAir the bags arent even loaded on the plane??? #Flight293
14044,American,@AmericanAir never got an update and we had the worst communication from u. Our flight delay was mechanical and not a word. #poorservice
14045,American,"@AmericanAir looks like I have. Best I can hope for I guess. It's on us air, so I don't think I'll get miles on Alaska. Which sucks."
14046,American,@AmericanAir my #Navy sisters flight 2470 cancld. She can't get an agent. They've called her back to be put on hold &amp; then discnct.Any help?
14047,American,@AmericanAir My wife &amp; infant daughter are on AA3195 ABI-DFW. En route but delayed. Can y‚Äôall hold AA1458 to RDU so they can connect?
14048,American,@AmericanAir Educate Bohol is a 501(c)(3) w/all volunteer staff. I can help the kids or buy a plane ticket--I can't do both. Can you help?
14049,American,@americanair anxious to see how you all care for customers you‚Äôve inconvenienced #Cancelled Flightledflight
14050,American,"@AmericanAir also the problem is not calling us at all. Other airlines send an automatic call and email, and they rebook as a courtesy."
14051,American,"@AmericanAir Why can't you handle your customers needs? Cancelled Flightled flight, 800 number leads to a quick ""Goodbye"" Very Sad!"
14052,American,@AmericanAir VERY upset that I cannot select seats for Tuesday flight online or over the phone. Terrible customer service :( Please help!
14053,American,"@AmericanAir I need to get from Albuquerque, NM, USA, to Cebu, Philippines. I'm providing educational help for 800 kids. Can you help me?"
14054,American,@AmericanAir already did &amp; an automated voice told us to wait 2 hours. They have yet to call back.
14055,American,@AmericanAir you changed my AAdvantage travel plans &amp; I called 800-433-7300 to get help but it sea ur too busy &amp; hangs up on me. What gives?
14056,American,"@AmericanAir yes, for tomorrow at 9 am. But I have to work though üòí I'm really mad about the situation"
14057,American,"@AmericanAir whenever I cheat on you it goes horribly wrong! I promise, I won't stray anymore. I'm talking about you @Delta!"
14058,American,"@AmericanAir @praywinn between understaffing, what looks like a labor slowdown, weather, incompetence, and disregard for the customer..."
14059,American,"@AmericanAir I need help with a reservation purchased on @AmericanAir but operated on @USAirways, can't get through on the 800#"
14060,American,@AmericanAir  flight from DFW to LIT tomorrow has been Cancelled Flightled.  What do I do next?  Pls advise.  #HELP

14064,American,@AmericanAir I can't choose a seat online because I booked on @priceline ??? #SMH
14065,American,@AmericanAir it wasn't really about the delay. It was more about being told the engine needed to be troubleshot.  Makes a person paranoid.
14066,American,"@AmericanAir ""overweight"" flight = you sold more tickets than you had seats. We all know that. Let's call it what it is."
14067,American,"@AmericanAir @jaynegelman How,about more@Blacklist too!!"
14068,American,@AmericanAir at JFK flight to Boston delayed 20 min waiting for catering they are boarding flight to LAX waiting for over and hour WTF?
14069,American,"@AmericanAir Yes, it says my reservation cannot be retrieved at this time. Also I never got an email from AA saying my flight was Cancelled Flightled."
14070,American,@AmericanAir Can you help with my Cancelled Flightled flight -- I'd like to book another flight...I've been on hold for 95 minutes and counting....
14071,American,@AmericanAir I ended up on a flight to LA my fourth time on standby. Thanks! http://t.co/NA5G5EAKPA
14072,American,@AmericanAir been waiting on hold for more than an hour

14074,American,"@AmericanAir that's ok, thanks for letting me know. Appreciate all the responses."
14075,American,@AmericanAir spoke too soon. 30 min Late Flightr still waiting for bags to load. Some sympathy would be appreciated at the very least.
14076,American,@AmericanAir @HeyMyNameIsSEAN Sean if you look at the AA schedule it sometimes gives you a clue if new'airplanes are used. They are gr8
14077,American,@AmericanAir thanks for the show! üëç
14078,American,"@AmericanAir well done, you have taken the fun out of air travel @PHLAirport"
14079,American,@AmericanAir no worries even though I was talking about seat assignment :)
14080,American,"@AmericanAir @kconti44 This looks like JFK - had a great pic of the OneWorld jets lined up on the opposite side #Air Berlin, LAN and AA."
14081,American,"@AmericanAir Been trying to call all day, get hung up on every time. Your guys are horrible!"
14082,American,"@AmericanAir @jameswester see, James, we only have 7 dedicated inbound phone lines because telephones eat into our billions in profits"
14083,American,@AmericanAir @superyan I did hear a last call for boarding of this flight when I was at JFK a few hours ago. good luck w/flights!
14084,American,"@AmericanAir , sitting on plane for 2.5hrs at gate due to computer sys issue, at what point do you Cancelled Flight a flight?, ridiculous @PHLAirport"
14085,American,@AmericanAir @cjdjpdx not a valid response in 2015 for a multinational corp whose profits are measured in billions. Stop understaffing!
14086,American,"@AmericanAir Yo, could that be a catering truck before mine eyes?  Unmoving? http://t.co/ASW6QwUf1Z"
14087,American,@AmericanAir @kaps12 this is an international airline that experienced record profits last quarter. But they can't staff a call center
14088,American,@AmericanAir Great seats on this aircraft!
14089,American,Is rudeness and poor customers service a job requirement at @AmericanAir ? Been waiting 28hrs and still haven't even seen one planeüò°
14090,American,@AmericanAir Both pictures taken at the same time but which is right? #totallyconfused http://t.co/dvSLtQZKmQ
14091,American,@AmericanAir AA919 flight attendant freaks out and leaves aircraft as passengers react to a 24h delay and cattle treatment. Surreal!
14092,American,@AmericanAir 901 #Miami to #Rio to participate at @RCM_Oficial representing @CisnerosMedia #yourstoryhere
14093,American,@AmericanAir a worker just checked for ice on our plane using his cell phone flashlight! Really?! Come on!
14094,American,@AmericanAir @cyncyn661 Are you now flying 763s to Madrid from JFK or is this DFW/ORD? Huge !!
14095,American,@AmericanAir The wine served in USAirways flights are watered down somehow right out of the bottles.
14096,American,@AmericanAir who's your pick for best picture? I don't want to board your airline until I know
14097,American,@AmericanAir we have 3 more passengers with me   There are two more reservation numbers
14098,American,"@AmericanAir @PatrichRuben no, profit maximization is your top priority. Nothing else even registers for you dinosaurs"
14099,American,@AmericanAir 8:30 departure?  Sure. Is there a catering strike at JFK?  @FoxNews @CNBC @BloombergRadio http://t.co/HPgXYZRW8o
14100,American,"@AmericanAir @derekc21 , so what would be a file number that works , needs to be 10 characters , email me derek.austin@century21.ca  easier"
14101,American,"@AmericanAir @manuel_c ""here for you"" as in, yeah, we'll tweet platitudes at you so you'll think our Twitter bot cares? Or...."
14102,American,@AmericanAir #flight293 was supposed to depart at 745 and at 815 we still have not boarded.
14103,American,@AmericanAir You have the worst customer service of any airlines I've ever encountered. Flat out awful
14104,American,"@AmericanAir @ezemanalyst why don't you tweet canned, impersonal responses as though this is the only impatient customer you've got"
14105,American,@AmericanAir DONE!! thank you so much!!
14106,American,@AmericanAir Nice AA employee making skillful excuses about Late Flightness due to catering snafu... http://t.co/YPVPVdlTYs
14107,American,@AmericanAir then taxi across dfw airport for 20 min to then state 75 min past departing from gate that we need deiced? Wow. Uncool &amp; untrue
14108,American,@AmericanAir 24 hrs &amp; 2 cncld flights Late Flightr I've landed in PHL. Now 30 mins &amp; counting on tarmac waiting for gate. Pls do better than this.
14109,American,"@AmericanAir delivered mom's delayed bag to the wrong place. 2 hrs on hold yesterday, &gt;1 hr today. Still no bag. #AA http://t.co/QKkJdFObOS"
14110,American,"@AmericanAir Yeah, try harder. No catering truck in sight.  Can we just leave now w/o the food won't eat anyway?"
14111,American,@AmericanAir this is awful customer service.
14112,American,@AmericanAir everything's good now brothaaaaaa
14113,American,@AmericanAir its pulling away from gate to get your departure time then leaving us on tarmac claiming power issues that magically repaired
14114,American,@AmericanAir 740pm wheels up to be exact.  I'm sending a DM.
14115,American,@AmericanAir @sarahzou translation: we don't reinvest our mammoth profits into the customer service experience. 'Cause we don't care.
14116,American,@AmericanAir OMG ANSWER YOUR PHONE I HAVE BEEN ON HOLD FOR 1.5 hours. Cancelled FlightED FLIGHTS SUCK
14117,American,@AmericanAir we are through. I can quit you. I am. The nonsense &amp; lies are a colossal infringement you can no longer get away with
14118,American,"@AmericanAir 719. Looks like we are about to get going, finally!"
14119,American,"@AmericanAir @JimDayTV no, you couldn't care less. That's why their customer service is run by bots"
14120,American,@AmericanAir pls tell me how to get a person on the phone asap
14121,American,@AmericanAir I have a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning and the 800 number did nothing! Please! I just want to go home!
14122,American,@AmericanAir you wont allow calls? My husband has a ticket but it looks like all the seats are taken? I cant even call.
14123,American,@AmericanAir yes but we HAVE TO GET HOME TOMORROW!!!! Please
14124,American,@AmericanAir unfriendly unhelpful agents. Unannounced gate changes. Delayed flight that we found out about by word of mouth
14125,American,@AmericanAir flight 3056 still sitting at DFW waiting for baggage to be loaded
14126,American,@AmericanAir I tried several times to select seats. The only ones ever available would've cost me $30 extra per seat.
14127,American,@AmericanAir we need a miracle @slcairport please help flight 1228 get out of here by 640 #FingersCrossed #pleasegod #missmykids
14128,American,@AmericanAir 3198 to AEX. Is it still going?
14129,American,@AmericanAir i do not want to stay overnight at this airport! I have been here since 11 am this morning!
14130,American,@AmericanAir finally about to take off! Thanks for the customer service by the g8 reps @ c17 @ CTL. Any idea what caused the system failure?
14131,American,@AmericanAir Trying to rebook a flight with you because of Cancelled Flightlation is a nightmare.  I was hung up on once. Can you help me rebook?
14132,American,"@AmericanAir i have tried getting help from agents, the phone, twitter, and FB. Can no one at American Airlines help me?"
14133,American,@AmericanAir Close down
14134,American,@AmericanAir it was 1265 coming and next catching 2396 home to DCA. Let's get another great leg too tonight!
14135,American,@AmericanAir i appreciate your apology. Sincerely. Thank you. That's really all I ever wanted to begin with.
14136,American,@AmericanAir AA 100 - good job overselling this flight. Delayed 90 minutes to deplane the overflow passengers' bags.
14137,American,@AmericanAir I‚Äôve been on the line waiting for 40 minutes again.
14138,American,@AmericanAir you know nothing about customer service and I'll make sure everyone knows it
14139,American,@AmericanAir I understand flight Cancelled Flightation but not being able to get through to change that flight for 6 hrs is not acceptable.
14140,American,@AmericanAir now I have to pay for a hotel a car ride miss classes which I pay 30k for and miss work and you tell me to talk to someone
14141,American,@AmericanAir your 1800 kept hanging up on me and made me miss a second flight
14142,American,@AmericanAir yeah that's not helping. Having my bag shipped to the correct city the first time probably would have helped.
14143,American,@AmericanAir I did 50 times and no one was helpful I'm missing work nd school nd the manager REM from mia told me he didn't want to talk us
14144,American,@AmericanAir My flight to @dfwairport was Cancelled Flightled. Mess ensued. Please thank the awesome Marcos (Concierge Key @ GRU) for sorting it out!
14145,American,@AmericanAir I haven't been rebooked. I called and left my number for a callback but haven't heard anything and my flight is tomorrow. :(
14146,American,@AmericanAir not enough push crews for JFK = 1.5 he delay and counting....
14147,American,@AmericanAir I cannot believe how long flight 759 PHI  is taking. I know it's US Airways but you own it. I would really like to get home.
14148,American,@AmericanAir Hopefully you guys are willing to cover my lovely car rental and living charges...I love being here for two extra days..
14149,American,@AmericanAir Same as yesterday's Cancelled Flighted flight. AA104. Your customer support is just awful!
14150,American,@AmericanAir big surprise flight 2330 is delayed. Hopefully not for 6 hours like our flight here.  Thanks again for a sleepless night.
14151,American,@AmericanAir really? Not even worthy of a response. This is beginning of a social media alert to the world that AA and @USAirways are useles
14152,American,@AmericanAir Hi AA friends! My sis's flight AA362 DFW&gt;&gt;MKE was Cancelled Flighted due to weather. Any way you can help here? What are her options?
14153,American,@AmericanAir is that something the crew on the current leg can request of the gate team on the next leg?
14154,American,@AmericanAir I have not. There's no option for even getting a call back!
14155,American,@AmericanAir tomorrows flight Cancelled Flighted. I understand. Three hour wait for a call back and now 60 minutes on hold. Not cool.
14156,American,@AmericanAir all flights Cancelled Flighted tomorrow and that means I'm stranded at the airport for the night... wow.
14157,American,@AmericanAir how hard is it to have catering ready to go?
14158,American,@AmericanAir Why does your iPhone app not have any sort of notifications option?
14159,American,@AmericanAir this is unbelievable and unacceptable. Flight #293. JFK. Everyone at the gate is upset as most of us have been here all day.
14160,American,"@AmericanAir I made my flight but then still had no update emails when I landed, no info ever sent on that or second flight. Losing my biz."
14161,American,@AmericanAir flight 3056 DFW still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded - still waiting
14162,American,@AmericanAir I still am not on a flight. Ive been here allll day and now we're not boarding because we're waiting for catering?
14163,American,@AmericanAir my husband and 5 year old son stuck overnight in DC thanks to 7 crew members arguing over who was boarding the flight
14164,American,@AmericanAir if this is how you guys work then i will never fly with you guys again.
14165,American,"@AmericanAir versus @JetBlue 
in Customer Service?
Who will win!
For Me @AmericanAir is a convenience to a trip to Cali &lt;3"
14166,American,"@AmericanAir agents refuse to help, ""too busy"" &amp; need to call advantage#. NO ONE willing to help and apparently being exec plat means ZERO"
14167,American,@AmericanAir fight got Cancelled Flighted can u help me rebook a flight?  Call center is too busy to answer calls or even put me on hold #yuck
14168,American,@AmericanAir you should be contacting her for a refund - dm me and I will provide phone number
14169,American,@AmericanAir ah if only we could get through. We've tried for over 2 hrs. Can we call @united?
14170,American,@AmericanAir this is ridiculous! You all really have terrible customer service and a lack of urgency. Im convinced.
14171,American,"@AmericanAir of course it wasn't your intention, issue lies in lack of response. she did contact you directly; she sat on hold for 50 mins"
14172,American,@AmericanAir I have been waiting at this airport since 11 am and have to wait until 8:30 tomorrow and cannot get any sort of help!
14173,American,@AmericanAir pathetic to have your gate agents lie to my face when you are at fault
14174,American,@AmericanAir trying to check in for flight. On line not working &amp; agents too busy to take my call.
14175,American,"@AmericanAir yep, they moved me to 16A as they showed me flying ""standby"""
14176,American,@AmericanAir understand the weather but would be nice to hear an apology on the phone when you moved my flight to an inconvenient day
14177,American,"@AmericanAir My baggage is lost, my flight Cancelled Flightled and i get no accommodations? Not even to another airline. At least one free hotel?"
14178,American,@AmericanAir I'm on 1024 into Dallas. Do I have any chance of catching 2238 to Boston? Do I need to run from Gate D6 to A15?.
14179,American,@AmericanAir AA I need a Hail Mary. How do I get from Dallas to Joplin JLN in the next 14 hours. Willing to fly to other airports and drive
14180,American,@AmericanAir I've been on hold for about 3 and a half hours now. Thanks for Cancelled Flighting my flight and not notifying me.
14181,American,@AmericanAir rude gate agent by AA363 ORD-LGA just now. Seems to have a temper. Made me check in a bag that fit INSIDE the sizer.
14182,American,"@AmericanAir Hi ho, hi ho. It's off to work I go. #WeeklyCommuteOnAA http://t.co/JQHg4jTm4w"
14183,American,@AmericanAir you put a sour taste on this customer‚Äôs vacation. it was joke watching those ‚Äúwe care thanks for choosing us‚Äù videos
14184,American,@AmericanAir are you expecting flights out of DFW to be Cancelled Flightled tomorrow AM and afternoon?
14185,American,@AmericanAir help us here !!! We are stuck here @jfk for more than 24hours! !we need to go home #flight919 #saveus
14186,American,@AmericanAir lets me get in line for call back in over 2 hours. I'll just hope the 1 ticket left on the flight I want is still there Late Flightr.
14187,American,@AmericanAir Flight  AA1691 LAX to LAS closes too early and gate agents give us hassles #PatheticCX
14188,American,@AmericanAir I am honestly in shock how this process and service compares to my other airline experiences. Not really sure what to say...
14189,American,"@AmericanAir here we go again #aa106 ""Plane not ready"". Are we going to find the crew run out of time again like last night #shortstaffed"
14190,American,@AmericanAir flight 3056 DFW still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded
14191,American,@AmericanAir At what e-mail adress can I send your CEO Mr. Doug Parker a letter that he hopefully reads?
14192,American,"@AmericanAir why does your customer service line say ""we are experiencing high call volume"" and then spontaneously hangup on the person?"
14193,American,@AmericanAir well its been over 4 hours now and still no one has picked up   try paying overtime and bring in more people
14194,American,@AmericanAir What's the best way to check on any delays or Cancelled Flightlations for my flight out of DFW on Tuesday?
14195,American,@americanair @bershawnjackson big UPS to Newark airport staff &amp;&amp; D.Dean. I was also treated lovely while I was in town. ‚ù§‚ù§

14205,American,@AmericanAir It just hangs up and your agents on the ground are useless. How don't I have a seat on a first class ticket booked weeks ago?
14206,American,@AmericanAir ive literally been holding for more than 2 HOURS now. i was told 2hrs. You all are sabotaging any chance i have of getting home
14207,American,@AmericanAir we're still here guys - you are the worst

14217,American,@AmericanAir Flight's Cancelled Flightled. Website says to call phone number.Phone says to check online.  How am I supposed to get some help?
14218,American,@AmericanAir yes. We spent the whole day talking to agents and someone finally offered to let him stay in a hotel
14219,American,@AmericanAir flight from JFK to EGE was cxld after on runway for an hour. Flight moved to 7am but they won't give luggage back. Nice.

14224,American,@AmericanAir there is a full flight of customers sitting on the plane waiting for baggage to be loaded on AA 356 in DFW - why? 2 hour delay
14225,American,@AmericanAir why a different airport! I have no way of getting to a different airport.
14226,American,"@AmericanAir AA agent said I repeated myself when I was explaining. I told him ""I understand English."" His reply?""Our conversation is over."""
14227,American,"@AmericanAir long wait? I literally went shopping at 3 different centers, had lunch and prepared dinner. surprise, it's winter! staff better"

14230,American,@AmericanAir Stuck on the plane in Charlotte.  Going to miss my connection.  No words from staff. Maybe some damn pretzels?

14241,American,@AmericanAir Considering it was purchased on the 21st and I attempted to use it again on the 21st I believe it would fit these parameters.
14242,American,"@AmericanAir pretty impressed with the in flight entertainment. Full touch, usable, smooth, good selection."
14243,American,@AmericanAir Now your site is not working! WTF
14244,American,"@AmericanAir @Delta @JetBlue can you help? @SpiritAirlines is in the wrong, stuck in Florida 3days. They need to learn from real airlines."

14247,American,@AmericanAir my flight has been delayed &amp; I can't talk reach anyone in customer service because of high call volume.

14279,American,@AmericanAir Thank you. Good suggestion. I checked and we were not rebooked. We'll keep checking and looking for other flights
14280,American,@AmericanAir they could be seen if your horrible customer service group would actually update the information! Never fly American again!
14281,American,@AmericanAir Am on web site requesting refund for Cancelled Flightled flight. It requires numerical document number. Where get it?
14282,American,"@AmericanAir Hmm. Looks like you looked at my tweet from last month, not this one. Was able to get U.K. agent to help me, thanks."
14283,American,"@AmericanAir Stuck on a plane at JFK: food was not on the plane now we need to wait crew to push back the plane. Good job, AA!"
14284,American,@AmericanAir no one met flight 1081 to LAX to tell passengers where to go or what flights they were rebooked on #badmgmt #AmericanAirlines
14285,American,@AmericanAir while I'm aggravated - shouldn't baggage fees disappear now that gas prices have dropped?
14286,American,"‚Äú@AmericanAir: @Dawn_Davis You're very welcome, Dawn. We love taking you flying. Let's do it again!‚Äù Again in 1 week!"

14292,American,@AmericanAir the fact that that rule makes it poor customer service. I can Cancelled Flight/change on @SouthwestAir with no penalty or hoops.
14293,American,@AmericanAir Thank you! You will see me :)

14297,American,@AmericanAir flight 1081 from IAD to LAX sat for more than 3hrs because ground crew couldn't drive in snow #badmgmt #AmericanAirlines
14298,American,"@AmericanAir Haha I had a boarding pass for 12B, was boarding the plane and the gate agent told me to go to 41G. I'm here now. No worries."
14299,American,@AmericanAir you cxl both my flights to/from DFW to CLL w/o notice then treat me like trash on the phone and offer no compensation? WTH?
14300,American,"As am I, @AmericanAir - but thankfully there was a @united lounge next door. Really not impressed by oneworld partnerships :("

14304,American,@AmericanAir You guys are totally losing me. I've been an AA fan for years but telling me reps are busy and hanging up on me is really bad.
14305,American,"@AmericanAir @NY_NJairports AA1224: 45 mins for Priority bags to arrive, now Late Flight for evening plans! Delta 20 min bag guarantee anyone? :("

14314,American,"@AmericanAir @SeguineJ AA - this is a joke, right? That line isn't even accepting calls right now - they just hang up."
14315,American,"@AmericanAir yes, and rebooked incorrectly."
14316,American,"@AmericanAir fair enough. But they could have at least told us. Once again it's the lack of communication. Delays happen, just tell me"
14317,American,@AmericanAir even with calls you haven't been able to help us anyway. #nevergettinghome
14318,American,@AmericanAir 2293 is the Cancelled Flightled one

14321,American,"@AmericanAir i was just severely upset by the rude cs rep. I get she's prob stressed, but I am too! An ""aw, let me help"" cld mk it btr"
14322,American,"@AmericanAir while I'm sensitive to this fact, I don't believe that warrants poor service. A little help &amp; compassion goes a long way."
14323,American,@AmericanAir Flight attendant #YeseniaHernandez provided excellent service among peculiar conditions throughout the day ‚úà :-)
14324,American,@AmericanAir I did. 5 times. With 4 of those being hung up on. The other one it finally sent me to the call back notification. #FixYourStuff

14328,American,@AmericanAir five times at last count
14329,American,@AmericanAir as usual my next flight shows on time but it's suppose to leave in 5 minutes and hasn't boarded
14330,American,@AmericanAir 250 I'm not sure if I'm rebooked now. In a line at airport trying to work it out. The earlier I can get to SFO the better:(

14339,American,@AmericanAir I've flown you many years without a complaint. You should start listening to your customers.  You went from first to worst
14340,American,@AmericanAir Cancelled Flightled 2 of my flights for maintenance. Customer service desk is empty... Can I get a hotel at least? http://t.co/ypbkCiRBXu
14341,American,@AmericanAir served me rubber pasta covered In sauce that tastes like plastic. Do you have any food for human consumption anymore ?
14342,American,"@AmericanAir why do #exp members have to wait ""over 2 hours"" to speak with an operator? Surely this is a mistake?"
14343,American,@AmericanAir u Cancelled Flightled my flight for tomorrow and tell me to call reservations but then refuse to take my call!!!  #not cool #hateful
14344,American,@AmericanAir No worries they called back 4 hrs Late Flightr while I was asleep and took an additional $200 fee. So by AA standards everything's gr8

14502,American,@AmericanAir I've been trying to change frm AA 2401 to LAX at 6:50am MONDAY morning then AA 2586 from LAX to FAT to flight AA 1359?#helpAA
14503,American,@AmericanAir are flights from Columbus Ohio to Dallas Texas Cancelled Flighted?
14504,American,"@AmericanAir @naomi_cooper Are you out of your mind, AA? What is the point of this Twitter acct? Form letters in 140 characters or less?"
14505,American,@AmericanAir  many have missed connections already b/c of delayed flight which will finally board soon
14506,American,@AmericanAir On flt 1627 from DFW to FAT on 2/23 and it was 86'd. Can you rebook me on the 1359 flight tonight? Can't get through on phone.
14507,American,@AmericanAir I wasn't important this morning when you would not seat my wife and I together or allow me to choose seats at Flight Booking Problems!!
14508,American,"@AmericanAir i dont believe it, it has been impossible for your agents to get an update from the delivery company since yesterday at 11 am"
14509,American,@AmericanAir yet there are plenty of available AA agents at gates nearby who say they are unable to help customers from our flight.
14510,American,"@AmericanAir @BDinDallas The personal touch you're known for, AA. Other cool perks: blaming understaffing on weather. And 3 hr hold times."
14511,American,"@AmericanAir been waiting in line for over an hour in San Antonio, barely moved &amp; only two agents. 30 in front of me &amp; at least 40 behind."
14512,American,@AmericanAir my return flight is scheduled on Wednesday; AA138 I believe.  Thanks for the help!
14513,American,@AmericanAir. You neglected to mention the $200 fee per ticket.  I had a medical reason and still have had to jump thru hoops.
14514,American,@AmericanAir ....I am on attempt #6 and hour #10 of calling and being put on hold.  Not feeling confident that I will ever get through...
14515,American,"@AmericanAir bought a ticket on @SouthwestAir. After two days, your ""team"" couldn't share the data needed to get me to my next meeting."
14516,American,@AmericanAir thanks for the response. I know it's not your fault... But Im in ORD in T5 and hungry if you want to stop by ‚úàÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è
14517,American,@AmericanAir cut it. Put me on a flt tomorrow.
14518,American,@AmericanAir nah u boofin u dont talk like any humans i know. Respond like u actually have a brain. And again i dont want customer relations
14519,American,@AmericanAir I have no transportation to and going to some other city and getting to NY sometime on Wed?! I'm sorry that's not gonna cut
14520,American,"@AmericanAir because of you, I am doing the one thing I tried to avoid. Thank you for sending me to baggage claim."
14521,American,@AmericanAir my flt is at 7a tom. I have now rec'd notification that I'm going out from some other airport
14522,American,@AmericanAir how does one book a ticket online and put it on hold?  Does that require that I pay for the ticket?
14523,American,@AmericanAir can you help me with a reservation? cant get through on the phone
14524,American,@AmericanAir ask the 10 people you left behind at Miami airport because you guys could not wait 5 minutes and ... http://t.co/XPM98Igqjn
14525,American,"@AmericanAir can you do anything to get #AA953 moving? Been almost 24 hrs and hundreds at jfk upset, tired and want to get to BA."
14526,American,@AmericanAir more of the insane treatment by your customers
14527,American,@americanair Help!  I need to speak to a live agent before I lose my online reservation being held.
14528,American,"@AmericanAir @_emmaclifford No. At JFK you sort of have to guess things out. It's a small airport, so whatever."
14529,American,@AmericanAir is this how you let your employees treat your loyal customers? #attackingbabymomma #crazinessintherockies
14530,American,@AmericanAir  Mad love http://t.co/4ojrSDWPkK NYC-
14531,American,"@AmericanAir thanks for forcing me to check -in my carry - on luggage. That is exactly why I spent extra money on ""travel size"" toiletries"
14532,American,"@AmericanAir @ejacqui If you updated the screens, then people would know the Late Flightst info, good or bad. And that wouldn't work because..."
14533,American,@AmericanAir missing a full days of work thanks guys
14534,American,@AmericanAir Trying to find out if flight #340 DFW to HOU is on tonight. Exec platinum desk not calling back and online info not clear.
14535,American,.@AmericanAir I can't even get on the phone with your reservations team. The system automatically disconnects us.
14536,American,@AmericanAir Flight Cancelled Flighted and rebooked but agent made a mistake and booked wrong date! Been trying to get through via phone for hours!!
14537,American,"@AmericanAir @russelneiss No, American. This is simple. How about YOU call HER back with the info for her new flight. Basic customer service"
14538,American,@AmericanAir I have looked and I was told it was in Guatemala last night. No record of anywhere today. I need my clothing for work tomorrow.
14539,American,"@AmericanAir Cool, a canned response. Nah, I think I'll keep tweeting at everyone who mentions AA on Twitter. You could DM me, though."
14540,American,@AmericanAir please fix your mobile and desktop site to allow Canadians to select a passenger when checking in. Thanks.
14541,American,@AmericanAir tried ringing but told me to try again Late Flightr. I'm supposed to be leaving in an hour...
14542,American,@AmericanAir You guys did an amazing job today! Know it‚Äôs hard; thanks to Kate Appleton for all her hard work reFlight Booking Problems my friends and me!
14543,American,.@AmericanAir cover a rental car or refund our ticket? - I'll gladly drive 10 hrs home than be stuck here till Tues!
14544,American,@AmericanAir should reconsider #usairways acquisition. Flight 1843 AA gold flyers insulted by attendant for hanging jacket!
14545,American,@AmericanAir   You neglected to mention the $200 fee per ticket.  I had a medical reason and still have had to jump thru hoops.
14546,American,@AmericanAir yes and I would like a refund.
14547,American,@AmericanAir how realistic is it to make an 80 minute domestic to international transfer at JFK for a non US citizen?
14548,American,Eliza &amp; I cheated on u @AmericanAir with @AirTahitiNui &amp; it was a lovely flight. But we'll be back! Lots!
14549,American,@AmericanAir I hope you like the photo :) http://t.co/p7fSLuxEGW
14550,American,"@AmericanAir @sweetmel If weather is bad, wouldn't your folks try extra hard to communicate...or load bags onto flight 1320...or...anything?"
14551,American,"@AmericanAir and how is this not a mechanical issue? All evidence points to the idea that it‚Äôs the ILS at CLL at fault, not the weather."
14552,American,"@AmericanAir @CAexhibitions Sorry in, like, a general way? Or sorry that incompetence/understaffing is compounding weather issues?"
14553,American,@AmericanAir please help us get home tomorrow!!!!!
14554,American,"@AmericanAir @tennetexan Too bad there's only, like, 3 people on that team, then. Because this is next level unreal."
14555,American,"@AmericanAir @marxsterbcow How is this a real life response to a customer service issue? Seriously. Keep trying to call us. Eh, might work."
14556,American,@AmericanAir fix the engine of flight AA3031so I don't spend all night in your airport so I can fly home tomorrow
14557,American,@AmericanAir Thank you.....you do the same!!
14558,American,@AmericanAir @ActingOutMgmnt Just make sure they remember to load the bags onto the plane. They Cancelled Flight the flight when they forget...
14559,American,"@AmericanAir @brewcrewfan8 Is this real life, AA? Like, 2015 real life? You should be emailing/calling/DMing people you've inconvenienced."
14560,American,@AmericanAir hey there me again from yesterday im still on hold
14561,American,@AmericanAir weather is unavoidable. Understaffing is controllable
14562,American,"@AmericanAir Not only was 5418 Late Flight, but we've been boarded and waiting for over 30min. WTF?"
14563,American,@AmericanAir @yvonneokaka When do I get my personal response and apology for your crew's having forgotten to load baggage onto my flight?
14564,American,@AmericanAir All flts to JFK Cancelled Flightled Thx to UR agent at SFO Im rebooked on UA. Didn't get name. She was awesome!  #twitterhug #shesaidrun
14565,American,@AmericanAir I know.  After an hour I got a live person.  It messes up our arrival and car plans at two airports and is costing us more.
14566,American,@AmericanAir I can't get ahold of aadvantage reservations.  I need to ticket a reservation that Cancelled Flights soon.  can you help?
14567,American,"@AmericanAir i was also told by agents my issues ""aren't their prob"" K fine. I get it. But have some compassion 4 others dealing w/this!!!"
14568,American,@AmericanAir What's the status at DFW? Ticket agent at gate A9 was very rude and unhelpful.
14569,American,@AmericanAir i was spoken 2 like I'm an idiot and that is not OK!! I don't need to deal w/ that esp after the travel experience I've had
14570,American,@AmericanAir I am trying to switch my flight to AA 1359 I am currently on AA 2401 at 6:50am MONDAY morn then AA 2586! Help Me!!
14571,American,@AmericanAir I really hope it departs. They said is because the catering service wasnt available but we can see it next to plane doing nthin
14572,American,@AmericanAir I understand weather is not your fault but ur cs reps are atrocious. I am NOT happy nor will I EVR fly w/ u again.
14573,American,"@AmericanAir When I left Orlando, I was 2nd in line for standby. I land and I'm 4th. 'Priority members get first available seats'. Awesome."
14574,American,@AmericanAir You didn't respond to my DM. You tweeted the same canned tweet you're telling everyone else.
14575,American,@AmericanAir I DMed you my AA &amp; phone #s &amp; you can't have someone call me? What was the point of your response? You didn't resolve anything!
14576,American,@AmericanAir don't you guys have an email address? Just put me on the next available flight from ohare
14577,American,@AmericanAir But Eagle is always Late Flight
14578,American,@AmericanAir I have never on all my trips on any airline ever nat'l or int'l ever experienced anything like this!
14579,American,"@AmericanAir your call center won't let me wait on hold, which I would happily do. Am I seriously supposed to just keep calling? Not great"
14580,American,@AmericanAir half hour Late Flight leaving DFW...no attempt at an explanation
14581,American,@AmericanAir I'm on flight 1027 tomorrow that got Cancelled Flightled. Need to find an alternative to get to Dallas. Please help.
14582,American,"@AmericanAir 30 minutes flight from OKC and then make us wait, 30 minutes cause the gate isn't empty.  #epicfail #poorplanning"
14583,American,"@AmericanAir seems like queue times are very high, in Q waiting for an agent 4 almost  an hour.Flight got Cancelled Flightled. http://t.co/sDm2wvR3zr"

14586,American,"@AmericanAir no hold times, just disconnections.   There is no excuse for that"
14587,American,".@AmericanAir nice 2 know. I paid 4 a seat. Then you sold my seat. now I bought a 3rd seat. It's a good scam, but a scam all the same."
14588,American,@AmericanAir I‚Äôll play it by ear. I know that you are doing your best. Buy some chewey oatmeal cookies for your customer care folks.
14589,American,"@AmericanAir if business class if full but 1st class empty, do you guys upgrade EXP members to 1st?"
14590,American,@AmericanAir I've been trying for 4 hours to get hold of someone.

14597,American,@AmericanAir we've been on hold for hours.
14598,American,@AmericanAir @Stone9956 Do you dislike delays when they're caused by YOUR crew forgetting to load bags &amp; lazy pilot wanting duty day to end?
14599,American,@AmericanAir can you guys help me please?
14600,American,@AmericanAir @travisamex It's not the weather. It's also gross incompetence. Understaffing. Crew forgetting to load bags. Don't duck truth.

14611,American,@AmericanAir I understand the weather issue but you can't expect passengers to wait 24 hours inside airports for whatever reason. Outrageous
14612,American,"@AmericanAir guarantee no retribution? If so, I'd be glad to share."
